so that those great men that were present did generally confess to it, saying,
"`they believed that this principle must go over the whole world.`"
There were at this meeting James Nayler, Thomas Goodyear,^
footnote:[Thomas Goodyear became a faithful minister,
and suffered much persecution and imprisonment.
When in Oxford jail (for refusing to swear) the jailer put irons on his legs.
The jailer also told the other prisoners if they wanted coats,
they might take those of the Friends off their backs;
but one of the prisoners answered he would go naked first.
