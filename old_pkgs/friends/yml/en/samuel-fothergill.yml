description:
  ​Samuel Fothergill (1715-1772) was the youngest son of eminent Quaker minister, John
  Fothergill. As a young man, Samuel yielded to various temptations, "giving way to the
  indulgence of his evil passions, and abandoning himself to the pursuit of folly and
  dissipation." So great was his rebellion against the Truth, that his father, upon
  embarking on a long trip to America, took leave of him with these words—"And now, son
  Samuel, farewell!—farewell!; and unless it be as a changed man, I cannot say that I have
  any wish ever to see you again." These words pierced Samuel's heart, and were used of
  the Lord as a means to turn him to the path of repentance and conversion. Feeling the
  terrors of the Lord for sin, Samuel was made willing to abide under His righteous
  judgments, and so yielded to the transforming power of divine grace that, in time, he
  became one of the most distinguished and influential ministers of his day.
