description:
  John Wigham (1749-1839) had strong desires raised in his heart to be the Lord's servant
  when only eight years old, and feeling that he could not serve Him acceptably without
  being preserved from evil, he began then to implore the Lord to purify his heart and to
  make him a useful vessel in His house. After marrying, and beginning to travel in the
  work of the ministry, he and his wife felt impressed of the Lord to move their family
  (of seven children) from England to Scotland, where he served the declining church for
  the remainder of his long and fruitful life, dying in Aberdeen at the age of 91.
