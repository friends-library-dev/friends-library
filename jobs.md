- upload consumable artifacts into cloud storage for public `kite update`

## Thorny Problems

- TITIP - a compilation composed of multiple small document from various authors
- IP complete works - a true multi-volume
- Piety Promoted - a true compilation, and multi-volume
- Shillitoe - a single volume too long to be printed in one paperback
- cover component - should be _repeatedly_ embeddable in website, in addition to producing
  PDFs and cover website
