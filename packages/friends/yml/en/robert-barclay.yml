  Robert Barclay (1648–1690) was born into opulence and educated in some of the finest
  schools of the time, where his natural genius gained the admiration of both teachers and
  peers. But at seventeen years of age, upon entering a meeting of the people called
  Quakers, he said, “I felt a secret power among them which touched my heart.” And as he
  abode under the powerful operations of grace, he “came to receive and bear witness of
  the Truth,” not being convinced “by strength of argument, or by a particular discussion
  of each doctrine, but by being secretly reached by Life.” Barclay's Apology for the True
  Christian Divinity was first published in 1675, and came to be considered the definitive
  exposition and defense of Quaker principles for the next 200 years.

    description:
      Robert Barclay writes, “All true and acceptable worship to God is offered in the
      inward and immediate moving and drawing of His own Spirit.” It is not hard to agree
      with such a statement, but who has indeed stood still to see the salvation of the
      Lord, and known the dawning of His inward Day? Have we waited upon our God to
      separate the precious from the vile within, to differentiate between the pure
      operation of His Spirit and the wild rovings of our own soul? Have we truly known
      and obeyed His inward stirrings and teachings, or does the Seed of God lay buried in
      Christian hearts beneath a mass of superstition, assumption, and fleshy, religious
      activity?

    description:
      Robert Barclay's "Apology for the True Christian Divinity" is perhaps the most
      well-known of all Friends' writings. "Saved to the Uttermost" (which is taken from
      propositions four through eight of the Apology) brilliantly expounds some of the
      most vital and misunderstood aspects of Christianity, plainly manifesting the true
      nature, experience, and extent of the salvation that God offers the soul through
      Jesus Christ.
