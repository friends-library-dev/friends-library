      Though [Robert Barclay’s] natural abilities were great enough to have made him
      surpass others in human learning, and so to have become famous among men, yet he so
      little valued that knowledge, that he in no way endeavored to be distinguished on
      that account. But his chief aim was to advance in real godliness, as the fellowship
      I had with him has undoubtedly assured me; for I was well acquainted with him.

    text:
      For what I have written comes more from my heart than from my head; from what I have
      heard with the ears of my soul and seen with my inward eyes, and my hands have
      handled of the Word of Life. What has been inwardly manifested to me of the things
      of God, that do I declare; not so much minding the eloquence and excellency of
      speech, as desiring to demonstrate the efficacy and operation of Truth.

description:
  Robert Barclay (1648–1690) was born into opulence and educated in some of the finest
  schools of the time, where his natural genius gained the admiration of both teachers and
  peers. But at seventeen years of age, upon entering a meeting of the people called
  Quakers, he said, “I felt a secret power among them which touched my heart.” And as he
  abode under the powerful operations of grace, he “came to receive and bear witness of
  the Truth,” not being convinced “by strength of argument, or by a particular discussion
  of each doctrine, but by being secretly reached by Life.” Barclay’s Apology for the True
  Christian Divinity was first published in 1675, and came to be considered the definitive
  exposition and defense of Quaker principles for the next 200 years.

    description:
      Robert Barclay writes, “All true and acceptable worship to God is offered in the
      inward and immediate moving and drawing of His own Spirit.” It is not hard to agree
      with such a statement, but who has indeed stood still to see the salvation of the
      Lord, and known the dawning of His inward Day? Have we waited upon our God to
      separate the precious from the vile within, to differentiate between the pure
      operation of His Spirit and the wild rovings of our own soul? Have we truly known
      and obeyed His inward stirrings and teachings, or does the Seed of God lay buried in
      Christian hearts beneath a mass of superstition, assumption, and fleshy, religious
      activity?
    partial_description:
      This treatise is a carefully modernized edition of the eleventh proposition of
      Robert Barclay’s “Apology for the True Christian Divinity”, showing the necessity
      and benefit of waiting upon the Lord for ability to worship, pray, and minister
      acceptably.

      Robert Barclay’s “Apology for the True Christian Divinity” is perhaps the most
      well-known of all Friends’ writings. “Saved to the Uttermost” (which is taken from
      propositions four through eight of the Apology) brilliantly expounds some of the
      most vital and misunderstood aspects of Christianity, plainly manifesting the true
      nature, experience, and extent of the salvation that God offers the soul through
      Jesus Christ.

      This publication is a short extract from the fifteenth proposition of Robert
      Barclay’s “Apology for the True Christian Divinity,” showing how most common forms
      of entertainment and recreation do but stifle the soul’s longings after God, and
      serve only to draw men out from His fear, making them forget heaven, death, and
      judgment, while at the same time fostering lust, vanity, and carelessness.
