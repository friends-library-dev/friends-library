description:
  ​Joseph Oxley (1715–1776) was a humble and sweet-spirited minister in the Society of
  Friends, whose life and service in the church manifested a total reliance upon the
  immediate empowering of the Spirit of Christ. Though he had a low opinion of himself, he
  was highly regarded and respected by all, and his ministry was known to be accompanied
  by that heavenly power which both confutes the proud and raises up the humble. He was
  led to preach the gospel in England, Ireland, Scotland, and the American Colonies, where
  his services were said to have “proceeded from the influence of the Minister of the
  sanctuary and true tabernacle, which God has pitched and not man.”
