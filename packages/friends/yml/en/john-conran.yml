    text:
      Yet those things which I had suffered were only as a beginning of sorrows; the
      ground of the heart was not to be lightly turned up, the gospel plough was to be
      introduced, and the fallow ground broken up, and I was to sow no more among thorns.
      The terrors of God's judgments were often set before my mind, and made such deep
      impressions as I believe will never be erased. It is a truth past all contradiction
      with me, that the Divine Spirit will not dwell in a temple which He has not
      previously cleansed in a great degree.

description:
  Until his mid 30's, John Conran (1739-1827) was a faithful and zealous member of the
  Church of England, but longing for true inward purity and transformation of soul, he
  attended a meeting of the Society of Friends where he was powerfully confronted by the
  Spirit of God. Having seen his true condition, and been somewhat awakened to Christ's
  baptism of the Holy Spirit and fire, he "denied himself, picked up his cross, and
  followed Christ," and so was made vessel of honor in the Lord's house. His struggles
  were many and painful, both with the enemies of his own soul, and with the declining
  condition of the Society of Friends. But John Conran kept the faith, and finished his
  race a monument to the heart-cleansing power of grace.
