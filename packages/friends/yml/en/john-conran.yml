description:
  Until his mid 30's, John Conran (1739-1827) was a faithful and zealous member of the
  Church of England, but longing for true inward purity and transformation of soul, he
  attended a meeting of the Society of Friends where he was powerfully confronted by the
  Spirit of God. Having seen his true condition, and been somewhat awakened to Christ's
  baptism of the Holy Spirit and fire, he "denied himself, picked up his cross, and
  followed Christ," and so was made vessel of honor in the Lord's house. His struggles
  were many and painful, both with the enemies of his own soul, and with the declining
  condition of the Society of Friends. But John Conran kept the faith, and finished his
  race a monument to the heart-cleansing power of grace.
