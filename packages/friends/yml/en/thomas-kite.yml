    text:
      We were not sent into the world to amuse ourselves, nor to accumulate earthly
      treasures, nor to gratify our own wills, nor the will of others, but to work out our
      own salvation with fear and trembling, and to stand devoted to the Lord’s cause in
      our day and generation.

description:
  Thomas Kite (1785-1845) lived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was a printer by trade.
  His early years, he says, “were exposed to the influence of bad example, and were marked
  by many follies,” yet the Lord followed him with the convictions of His Spirit and at
  last prevailed upon him to make a total surrender. As an adult he travelled much in the
  work of the ministry, often pressing the necessity of walking “in the old-fashioned way
  of the cross.” He was a shining example in his generation of both childlike humility and
  unflinching boldness, contending earnestly for the faith which was once for all
  delivered to the saints, and remaining faithful to it during the troublesome times of
  the Hicksite and Gurneyite separations.
