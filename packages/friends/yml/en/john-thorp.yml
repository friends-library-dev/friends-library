description:
  John Thorp (1742-1817) was not brought up a member of the Society of Friends, but from
  very early life, was aware of the workings of evil in his own heart, and also the
  manifestation of the divine Seed of light and grace which showed him the evil. Finding
  himself very frequently confounded and sorrowful because of the strength of his
  unrestrained self-will, he was led to consider whether this was the irrevocable lot of
  man, or whether there was a possibility of deliverance from such a state. In this humble
  and seeking condition, he was taught to deny himself and bear the cross patiently, and
  thus it became more and more his delight to walk in that law which is light, and to live
  continually as in the Lord’s holy presence. John Thorp’s deep experience of the trials
  and perplexities of the Christian race, and his patient wading through seasons of great
  weakness, barrenness, and suffering, made him conspicuous for his ability to “comfort
  others with the comfort with which he himself was comforted by God.”
