description:
  â€‹At the age of twenty-two, Samuel Neale (1729-1792) was powerfully impacted by the
  ministry of Catharine Payton and Mary Peisley (his future wife) while they were
  ministering in the city of Dublin, Ireland. Having seen and felt that he was traveling
  on the broad path that leads to destruction, Samuel Neale set his heart to "wait upon
  the Lord in the way of His judgments." Having become acquainted with the true baptism of
  Christ (that of Spirit and fire), he was soon called into the ministry, and labored
  diligently for the remainder of his life. His journal and letters demonstrate all of the
  sweetness, humility, and wisdom of a true disciple of Jesus Christ.
