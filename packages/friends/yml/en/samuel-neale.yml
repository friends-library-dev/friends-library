    text:
      Samuel Neale, who had been forgiven much, loved much; and having been obedient to
      the heavenly vision, became a vessel of honour, replenished with good, and pouring
      it forth for the refreshment of others. He was one, who, remembering the trials
      which attend youth, felt compassion for them; and in advanced life, his winning
      affability towards young persons, his fatherly love and care, his heart and house
      open to receive them, made a deep impression on their minds, from which many
      received lasting advantage.

    text:
      I have been greatly pleased formerly, when favoured with your company, to observe
      the watchful care that clothed you, even in the times of enlargement and liberty of
      spirit, lest any word or unguarded expression should inadvertently pass from you, to
      wound or administer offence, in any way, to the least babe in Christ.

description:
  ​At the age of twenty-two, Samuel Neale (1729-1792) was powerfully impacted by the
  ministry of Catharine Payton and Mary Peisley (his future wife) while they were
  ministering in the city of Dublin, Ireland. Having seen and felt that he was traveling
  on the broad path that leads to destruction, Samuel Neale set his heart to “wait upon
  the Lord in the way of His judgments.” Having become acquainted with the true baptism of
  Christ (that of Spirit and fire), he was soon called into the ministry, and labored
  diligently for the remainder of his life. His journal and letters demonstrate all of the
  sweetness, humility, and wisdom of a true disciple of Jesus Christ.

        description:
          When twenty-two years of age, Samuel Neale was powerfully impacted by the
          ministry of Catherine Payton and Mary Peisley at a meeting in Dublin. Spending
          much time with these “heavenly messengers”, Mary Peisley became a beloved friend
          and spiritual confidant, and the two were married in 1757.

        description:
          Meeting Joseph Oxley as he passed through Ireland in the work of the ministry,
          Samuel Neale “felt an attracting draft of uniting love draw me to accompany him”
          in some further gospel labors. Neale became closely bound to this “agreeable,
          sweet-spirited friend,” and the two of them were later companions in the
          ministry during an extended trip to America.
