description:
  Frederick Smith (1757-1823) was not born into the Society of Friends, and according to
  his own account, spent the first part of his life in great rebellion against both the
  convictions of the Spirit and the admonitions of his parents. By nine years of age, he
  had become “a little monster of iniquity,” and by twenty, he claims “there were few that
  exceeded me in vicious conduct.” But the Lord, in His mercy, met him in the path of
  destruction and called him down from the heights of his pride and ambition. And though
  changing his course after such a career of iniquity brought him into many “agonizing
  tortures” in both family and career, and into judgments mixed with mercy in the depths
  of his own heart, his life became an undeniable instance of the “washing of regeneration
  and renewing of the Holy Spirit.”
