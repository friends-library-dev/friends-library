      Ann Crowley, a young woman, sat near me, and appeared under exercise, but did not
      give up to speak; and at the grave I thought she again appeared under a concern to
      express something to the people; so I took her by the arm and put her before me, and
      soon after she spoke, and thus opened a door for me to labour.

description:
  Ann Crowley (1765-1926) was one of eight sisters who lived together for many years in
  spiritual unity and tender affection. Though all of her siblings appear to have been
  preachers of righteousness in life and conduct, Ann was called of the Lord to serve Him
  in a more public sphere. Being of a shy and unassuming character, she was for some time
  unwilling to open her mouth in the assemblies of God’s people. But by the “operation of
  divine love” upon her heart, she was eventually brought to a state of resignation, and
  with the encouragement of some valuable Friends (like Debra Darby and Thomas
  Scattergood), she put her hand to the gospel plow and never looked back.

        description:
          During his six years in Europe in the service of the gospel, Thomas Scattergood
          was like a “father in Israel” to young Ann Crowley, often giving her counsel and
          encouragement in the path of discipleship and in the work of the ministry.
          Several lengthly letters from Ann were published in the journal of Thomas
          Scattergood, and now have been appended to the memoir of her life.
