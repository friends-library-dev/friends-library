    text:
      Disappointment has a tendency, if we are well-disposed, to drive us nearer to God by
      weaning us, little by little, from other things. Thus came that wonder of his age,
      the blessed John Woolman, to witness his works go so fully beforehand to judgment,
      that he was dead whilst yet alive in the body.

    text:
      Here I saw John Woolman for the first time; I take him to be a sweet, clean-spirited
      Friend; his unity with the true Seed may be felt by his savory conversation and
      pious self-denying life.

description:
  Because of his writings against slavery and other social evils, John Woolman (1720-1772)
  is one of the most well-known Quakers from the 18th century. Unfortunately, several
  heavily edited versions of his journal exist today which have removed important aspects
  of his Christian faith and experience, rendering him only a philanthropist and
  abolitionist. The truth is that John Woolman was a devoted servant of Jesus Christ, a
  preacher of truth and righteousness, and a man filled with the Spirit and love of God
  that overflowed towards his fellow creatures. This edition contains his unabridged
  journal and works.
