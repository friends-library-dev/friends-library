description:
  Because of his writings against slavery and other social evils, John Woolman (1720-1772)
  is one of the most well-known Quakers from the 18th century. Unfortunately, several
  heavily edited versions of his journal exist today which have removed important aspects
  of his Christian faith and experience, rendering him little more than a philanthropist
  and abolitionist. The truth is that John Woolman was a devoted servant of Jesus Christ,
  a preacher of truth and righteousness, and a man filled with the Spirit and love of God
  that overflowed towards his fellow creatures. This edition contains his unabridged
  journal and works.
