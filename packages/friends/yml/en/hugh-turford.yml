      "The grounds of a holy life; or, The way by which many who had been heathens, came
      to be renowned Christians; and such as are now sinners, may come to be numbered with
      saints, with little or no outward preaching: to which is added, Paul's speech to
      Titus, called the first bishop of Crete: and also, A true touchstone, or trial of
      Christianity."
    description:
      The primitive Christians built on a sure rock, a living foundation, on Christ as He
      was in all ages, and still is—on His spiritual appearance as the light of the world,
      and the life of righteousness. Taking His eternal Spirit in themselves for their
      guide, they turned away from whatever they were thereby convicted of and reproved
      for. Thus Esau (or the first nature) came to be supplanted, and He whose right it is
      to reign came to have the rule in them and the government over them. The work of
      sanctification is inward, and is to be effected by inward means. Nothing but inward
      light can expel inward darkness; nothing less than eternal life can deliver our
      souls from the power of death. But this way of God’s salvation has been so long
      rejected, that few in our present age know what this Spirit is, where they may
      become acquaintance with it, or how they may walk in it.
