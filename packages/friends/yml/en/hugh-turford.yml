description:
  The primitive Christians built on a sure rock, a living foundation, on Christ as He was
  in all ages, and still is--on His spiritual appeareance as the light of the world, and
  the life of righteousness. His work of sanctification is inward, and is to be effected
  by inward means. Nothing but inward light can expell inward darkness; nothing less than
  eternal life can deliver our souls from the power of death. But this way of God’s
  salvation has been so long rejected, that few in our present age know what His Spirit
  is, where they may become acquainted with it, or how they may walk in it.

      "The grounds of a holy life; or, The way by which many who had been heathens, came
      to be renowned Christians; and such as are now sinners, may come to be numbered with
      saints, with little or no outward preaching: to which is added, Paul's speech to
      Titus, called the first bishop of Crete: and also, A true touchstone, or trial of
      Christianity."
