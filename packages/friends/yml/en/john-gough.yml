      I understand John Gough has lately had an alarming paralytic stroke, which nearly
      deprived him of the use of one side for some time; but was so far recovered as to be
      able to attend their late quarterly meeting near Charlemont, where he had very
      acceptable service, appearing with increasing brightness in his Master’s cause, who,
      I trust, will strengthen him every way for this fresh service. I love to see people
      so devoted, so dedicated, so set upon promoting the cause of Christ.

description:
  Like his older brother James, John Gough (1721-1791) was gifted with a keen intellect
  and so excelled in his studies that he became an assistant to a Friends school in
  Wiltshire when only sixteen years of age. As an adult he became master of boarding
  schools in Cork, Dublin, and Lisburn, but was also very active in the work of the
  ministry, both preaching and writing for the advancement of the gospel. In 1782, when
  sixty-one years of age, he commenced his four-volume History of the Society of Friends,
  which occupied him for eight years, and was published in 1790. This immense work gave a
  full, clear, and accurate portrayal of the history of Friends, adding valuable
  information to what had already been recorded in Sewel’s “History,” and continuing the
  history of this people until 1764.
