    text:
      Oh, how truly cheering it is to witness and contemplate the state in which Divine
      Goodness has kept you to this day! I can look back to my childhood, when I first saw
      with wonder the tears flowing from your eyes in meetings; when you were an example
      to many of nobly denying self, taking up the cross, and following Him.

description:
  Mary Capper (1755-1845) was raised up in the strict observance of the rites and
  ceremonies of the church of England, but found her heart longing for a greater
  experience of the inward life and power of the gospel. Upon being convinced of the
  principles of Friends, she was told by her father "not to return to the parental roof"
  until she would conform to the religious education that she had been given. But finding
  that true peace of mind depended upon simple obedience to the Lord's requirements, she
  continued in faithful adherence to the way of the cross, and in time could boldly
  testify that "every sacrifice made in obedience, was rewarded a hundred fold."
