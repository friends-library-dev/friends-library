    description:
      This letter was written by Catherine Phillips in 1753 to her brother Henry Payton,
      who she feared had “strayed from the path of peace and safety, to seek satisfaction
      in the grasp of empty bubbles, which had assumed the form, in his sight, of
      something substantial.”
