    text:
      About two years ago, to my humble admiration, in a season of great proving of spirit
      it was so renewed and sealed to me (the inward attraction bing so strong, and the
      evidence so undoubtable) that [Catherine Payton] was a faithful follower of the
      Lamb; for a language sweetly flowed through my mind, "I have chosen her and she is
      mine"--so that I not only rejoiced, but was strengthened.

  Catherine Payton (1727-1794 — also known by her married name, Catherine Phillips) was an
  eminently gifted minister in the Society of Friends, who traveled almost continually for
  forty years in the service of Truth throughout England, Ireland, and North America. Her
  journal and letters clearly demonstrate a life entirely surrendered to the cross of
  Christ, a mind supplied with wisdom and utterance from on high, and a heart filled with
  love for God and for mankind.

          Until her death in 1757, Mary Peisley (Neale) was a frequent traveling companion
          of Catherine Payton, and perhaps her most intimate friend in the work of the
          ministry.

    description:
      Catherine Payton (1727-1794 — also known by her married name, Catherine Phillips)
      was an eminently gifted minister in the Society of Friends, who traveled almost
      continually for forty years in the service of Truth. Her journal and letters clearly
      demonstrate a life entirely surrendered to the cross of Christ, a mind supplied with
      wisdom and utterance from on high, and a heart filled with love for God and for
      mankind. This short extract contains a serious and convincing letter to her brother
      Henry, whom she feared had drifted away from the path of peace.
    partial_description:
      This letter was written by Catherine Phillips in 1753 to her brother Henry Payton,
      who she feared had “strayed from the path of peace and safety, to seek satisfaction
      in the grasp of empty bubbles, which had assumed the form, in his sight, of
      something substantial.”
