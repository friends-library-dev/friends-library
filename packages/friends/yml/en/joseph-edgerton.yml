description:
  Joseph Edgerton (1797-1875) was one of the few faithful Friends in the mid 19th century
  that held fast to the Truth, even as the long-favored Society of Friends crumbled to
  pieces on the right hand and on the left. He was acknowledged a minister of the gospel
  in 1833, and travelled extensively in that capacity a great part of his life. He was
  valiant for the Truth in his day, standing forth in unflinching support of the original
  doctrines and testimonies of the Society of Friends. The cleansing, purifying power of
  the Lord Jesus in His inward and spiritual appearance in the heart was frequently the
  subject of his preaching, and his greatest desire was that all would experience a growth
  in the true grace of God, and so be continually "taking root downward, and bringing
  forth fruit upward."
