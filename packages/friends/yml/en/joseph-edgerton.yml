description: â€‹Joseph Edgerton (1797-1875) was one of the few faithful Friends in the 19th century that held fast to the Truth even as the long-favored Society of Friends crumbled to the earth on the right hand and on the left. He was acknowledged a minister of the gospel in 1833, and travelled extensively in that capaity a great part of the time during the subsequent years of his life. He was valiant for the Truth in his day, standing forth in unflinching support of the original doctrines and testimonies of the Society of Friends. The cleansing, purifying power of the Lord Jesus, in His inward and spiritual appearance in the heart, was frequently the subject of his preaching, and his greatest desire was that all would experience a growth in the true grace of God, and so be continually "taking root downward, and bringing forth fruit upward."
