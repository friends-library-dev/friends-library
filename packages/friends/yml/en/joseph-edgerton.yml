description:
  â€‹Joseph Edgerton (1797-1875) was one of the few faithful Friends in the 19th century
  that held fast to the Truth even as the long-favored Society of Friends crumbled to the
  earth on the right hand and on the left. He was acknowledged a minister of the gospel in
  1833, and travelled extensively in that capaity a great part of the time during the
  subsequent years of his life. He was valiant for the Truth in his day, standing forth in
  unflinching support of the original doctrines and testimonies of the Society of Friends.
  The cleansing, purifying power of the Lord Jesus, in His inward and spiritual appearance
  in the heart, was frequently the subject of his preaching, and his greatest desire was
  that all would experience a growth in the true grace of God, and so be continually
  "taking root downward, and bringing forth fruit upward."

      This journal was kept by Joseph Edgerton throughout the totality of his adult life,
      and describes many of his spiritual and ministerial experiences, his long travels,
      inward and outward trials, and frequent sorrows over the declining state of the
      Society of Friends (especially due to the spread of both Hicksite and Gurneyite

      Society of Friends, written by Edgerton in 1841.
