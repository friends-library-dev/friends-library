    text:
      Gilbert Latey, through the powerful operations of the spirit of Christ in his soul,
      was brought to that depth of self-denial, that he could not join with that proud
      spirit in other people, which inclined them to want vanities and superfluities. This
      Friend was often amongst the chief rulers of the nation in times of persecution, and
      it appears by the testimony of Friends, that his dwelling was so evidently in the
      pure life of Truth, that in his visits to those great men, he found a place in their
      minds.

description:
  Gilbert Latey (1626-1705) was convinced of the truth through the powerful preaching of
  Edward Burrough in the year 1654, and continued a faithful and tireless disciple of
  Christ until his death in 1705. The memoir of his life (written by his nephew Richard
  Hawkins, with whom he lived for forty-two years) is both a narrative of the most
  remarkable events in Gilbert’s life, and a historical account of the first ministers and
  established meetings of Friends in London. Included in this history is also a sobering
  account of the Great Plague of London in 1655, the last major epidemic of the bubonic
  plague to occur in England.
