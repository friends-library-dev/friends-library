    text:
      I visited Elizabeth Ussher, and found her in much Christian resignation to the will
      of the Lord, though her third lovely daughter was to be buried today; having lost
      two others in a consumption, and a son in another way, within twelve months; her
      father at this time lying a corpse, and her fourth and last daughter likely very
      soon to follow her sisters in the same disease. Her state of mind, as well as that
      of her dear remaining daughter, was truly instructive to me.

description:
  After a marriage of seventeen years, Elizabeth Ussher (1749-1817) was left a widow, and
  soon after deprived of her two eldest sons by death on a foreign shore. Under the weight
  of these trials, she and her four remaining daughters were powerfully awakened to the
  cost of true discipleship and convinced of the principles professed by Friends. But in
  the two years immediately following this great change, Elizabeth had to endure the death
  of all four of her daughters by consumption. The letters of these extraordinary and
  pious young women, written during the last few years of their short lives, were
  collected and published by their mother after their decease.

        description:
          During his travels in the work of the ministry, William Savery spent many months
          in Ireland, and on several occasions very favorably mentions his encounters with
          Elizabeth Ussher and her "excellent daughters." He was present at (or very near)
          the death of Judith Ussher, and remarked that "all felt like peace around her
          bed."

          Mary Dudley was one of the ministers in the Society of Friends who befriended
          and ministered to Elizabeth Ussher at a time when she was grieving the death of
          her husband and sons, and seriously enquiring after the way of life and peace.
