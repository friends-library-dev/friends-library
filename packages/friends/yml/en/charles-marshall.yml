    text:
      I have learned from the beginning of the work of restoration and redemption, that
      every one's preservation is found in pure inward retiredness unto the Lord; and in
      His pure fear, awe and dread to keep low, feeling after His soul-redeeming,
      soul-preserving, holy power, which quickens and enlivens; and as it is abode with
      and in, keeps alive in its own pure nature and quality, over the world, its spirit
      and defilement.

  Charles Marshall (1637-1698) was convinced of the Truth at age seventeen by the powerful
  ministry of John Audland and John Camm, and eventually became a worthy minister and
  elder himself in the early Society of Friends. This short but instructive journal
  describes Marshall’s progressive experience of the light of Jesus Christ, both as his
  judge and teacher, and also uncovers the several snares and temptations of the enemy
  that he met with and overcame along the way.

      Charles Marshall (1637-1698) was convinced of the Truth at age seventeen by the
      powerful ministry of John Audland and John Camm, and eventually became a worthy
      minister and elder himself in the early Society of Friends. This short treatise,
      written in 1673, describes the miserable condition of man in the fall, the means by
      which God restores the penitent soul into the image of God, and many snares,
      deceptions and temptations of the enemy of man's happiness.
