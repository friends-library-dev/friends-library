description:
  Charles Marshall (1637-1698) was convinced of the Truth at age seventeen by the powerful
  ministry of John Audland and John Camm, and eventually became a worthy minister and
  elder himself in the early Society of Friends. This short but instructive journal
  describes Marshall’s progressive experience of the light of Jesus Christ, both as his
  judge and teacher, and also uncovers the several snares and temptations of the enemy
  that he met with and overcame along the way.

      The original title of this short work is perhaps the best description of its
      contents-- “The Way of Life Revealed and the Way of Death Discovered; Wherein is
      Declared Man’s Happy State Before the Fall, His Miserable State in the Fall, and the
      Way of Restoration Out of the Fall, Into the Image of God Again, In Which Man Was
      Before the Fall.”
