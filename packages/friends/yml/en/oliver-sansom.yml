description:
  Oliver Sansom (1636-1710) was an early minister in the Society of Friends, whose heart
  was first awakened to the Truth while reading a work of Isaac Penington’s entitled, “The
  Way of Life and Death Made Manifest and Set Before Men.” Feeling it required of him to
  break off from the national church, with its man-made traditions and obligatory tithes,
  he became the target of great persecution, and spent many years in jail. Speaking of him
  after his death, Thomas Ellwood wrote, “I have this testimony to bear of his honest and
  innocent life; he was a good steward of his Master’s treasures, a faithful dispenser of
  divine mysteries committed to him, an inward and heavenly-minded man. He was more in
  substance than in show, greater in power than in expression, a man of a meek and quiet
  spirit, yet full zeal—who lived and died a servant of the Lord.”
