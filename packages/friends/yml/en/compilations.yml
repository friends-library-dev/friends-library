    title: Truth in the Inward Parts
    slug: truth-in-the-inward-parts
    filename: Truth_in_the_Inward_Parts
    description: This book contains the stories of ten men and women who knew the transforming work of Truth in the inner parts. Amidst a sea of Christian practice and profession, these believers would settle for nothing less than the light, power, and righteousness of Christ reigning in their purified vessels. They not only found the Pearl of great price by His own inward appearing, but they then sold all to buy this treasure, counting all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus their Lord. (Compiled and edited by Jason R. Henderson in 2016.)
