  A few of our books were not written by a single person, but are collections of writings
  or letters from several different authors. Some of these books were compiled and
  published long ago by early Friends, and some were compiled more recently by the editors
  of this website.

      This book contains the autobiographical accounts of ten men and women who
      experienced the transforming power of “Truth in the inward parts” (Psalm 51:6).
      Amidst a sea of Christian opinions and traditions, these believers would settle for

      purified hearts.

      This book contains the stories of ten men and women who knew the transforming work
      of “Truth in the inward parts.” Amidst a sea of Christian practice and profession,
      these believers would settle for nothing less than the light, power, and
      righteousness of Christ reigning in their purified vessels. They not only found the
      Pearl of great price by His own inward appearing, but they then sold all to buy this
      treasure, counting all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ
      Jesus their Lord. (Compiled and edited by Jason R. Henderson)

      of Many of the People Called Quakers; With a Brief Account of Some of Their Labors
      in the Gospel, and Sufferings for the Same.” These four volumes extend over a period
      of more than one hundred and seventy years, and contain concise accounts of the
      godly lives and remarkable deaths of more than six hundred persons. Among these
      there is found a great variety in age, condition in life, station in the Church, and
      growth in spiritual knowledge and experience; but they all agree in a united
      testimony to the blessed effects of Christ’s reign in the soul, and to the
      consolation and support it furnishes on a death bed.
