description:
  David Sands (1745-1816) was an active and influential minister in the Society of Friends
  at a time when the minds of many Friends (particularly in Ireland) had been led astray
  from the simplicity and purity of devotion to Christ. Originally from Long Island, Sands
  labored extensively throughout New England, and also made a lengthy trip to Europe where
  he preached the gospel in England, Ireland, France, Germany, and several other parts of
  the continent. His life was fraught with many deep conflicts, difficulties, and
  opposition, but he remained a faithful pillar in the church, and an example humility and
  self-denial, in the midst of a much deteriorated Society.

        description:
          In 1796, William Savery and David Sands travelled together in the work of the
          ministry through Holland, Germany, France, and several other parts of Europe. In
          France, the two of them had an unexpected encounter with the notorious Thomas
          Paine, and ably defended the gospel against his "passionate railing."
