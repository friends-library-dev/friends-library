description:
  The humility and simplicity of John Pemberton (1727-1795), united with an ardent love
  for his fellow creatures and a desire for their everlasting welfare, made him an eminent
  and much-beloved minister in the Society of Friends. Though his journal speaks much of
  his weakness and struggles, and little of his gifts and attainments, yet he was highly
  esteemed by even the most notable ministers of his day. Rebecca Jones records in her
  journal, “George Dillwyn has sometimes made a comparison between some of us and John
  Pemberton, that we are as fishing with a crooked pin and thread, while John is casting
  his net into the sea.” The reader will be amply repaid for tracing the footsteps of a
  man much weaned from the spirit and ways of the world, who eagerly endeavoured to
  perform his day’s work in the day time.
