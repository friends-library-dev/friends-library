description:
  The ​​simplicity, meekness and diffidence​ of John Pemberton (1727-1795)​, united with
  an ardent love for his fellow creatures​ and a desire for their everlasting welfare​,
  made him a eminent and much-beloved minister in the Society of Friends. ​​​An abiding
  sense of the Divine presence seemed to cover his spirit wherever he traveled; and though
  his journal speaks much of his weakness and struggles, and little of his gifts and great
  usefulness in the church of God, yet the reader will be amply repaid for tracing the
  footsteps of a man much weaned from the spirit and​ ways of the world, who eagerly
  endeavoured to perform his day’s work in the day time, looking not for the acceptance of
  man, but for the testimony of a clean conscience in the faifthful service of his Lord
  and Master.
