description:
  William Ellis (1658-1709) was convinced of the blessed Truth at eighteen years of age
  when working as an apprentice to a linen-weaver in Skipton, England. Both he and his
  wife Alice became faithful laborers in the harvest of the Lord, giving themselves to
  spend and be spent in Truth’s service, in feeding and overseeing the flock of Christ in
  England and abroad. The letters and papers contained in this memoir plainly manifest the
  uncompromising submission to the Spirit of Truth which so characterized the early
  Society of Friends. The lives and gospel labors of this pious couple shined with true
  Christian humility, honesty, and single-hearted devotion, and with a genuine concern
  that all the Lord’s people walk in the beauty of holiness under government of the
  Spirit.
