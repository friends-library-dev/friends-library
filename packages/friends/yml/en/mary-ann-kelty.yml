    text:
      Permit the word of exhortation, upon a point wherein it seems to me you are in some
      danger--it is that of mixing up the pure, distinct, interior principle of faith in
      the gift of God, as an invisible and spiritual thing, only to be known, apprehended,
      believed in, felt, and obeyed, by the inward senses of the new-born creatureâ€”-I say,
      it is to be feared, that you mix and confound this precious, living thing, with the
      notional, historical knowledge, which is to be picked up from the letter that
      describes it.

description:
  Mary Ann Kelty (1789-1873) was a teacher and author in England who appears to have
  discovered the writings of early Friends later in her life. Though she plainly shows
  herself to be in perfect accord with the principles and practices of the primitive
  Quakers, she lived in a time of great declension form the original purity and power in
  the Society, and probably for that reason, never formally joined with them in membership
  (though she is said to have frequently attended the Friends' meeting house at Peckham).
  Her book "The Lives and Persecutions of the Primitive Quakers" is a very well-written,
  short history of the early Society of Friends, highlighting the most noteworthy figures
  and remarkable events of that time.

    partial_description:
      A short history of the remarkable lives and relentless persecutions of the primitive
      Quakers, demonstrating their deep root in the life and substance of true
      Christianity, and their willingness to "spend and be spent" for the Truth as it is
      in Jesus.

          Both the lives and the sufferings of the Friends mentioned in Mary Ann Kelty's
          history, are related in much greater detail in William Sewel's classic "History
          of the Rise, Increase, and Progress of that Christian People Called Quakers."
