gender: female
description:
  Mary Ann Kelty (1789-1873) was a teacher and author in England who appears to have
  discovered the writings of early Friends later in her life. Though she plainly shows
  herself to be in perfect accord with the principles and practices of the primitive
  Quakers, she lived in a time of great declension form the original purity and power in
  the Society, and probably for that reason, never formally joined with them in membership
  (though she is said to have frequently attended the Friends' meeting house at Peckham).
  Her book "The Lives and Persecutions of the Primitive Quakers" is a very well-written,
  short history of the early Society of Friends, highlighting the most noteworthy figures
  and remarkable events of that time.
