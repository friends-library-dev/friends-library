description:
  James Nayler was a prominent leader in the early Society of Friends in England. Though a
  farmer by trade, and a man of limited education, his deep spiritual understanding,
  piercing discernment, and powerful preaching of the gospel caused multitudes to
  acknowledge that he spoke in the demonstration of the Spirit and power, as one having
  authority, and not as the scribes. Sadly, he is best known for a single (and deeply
  regretted) act of folly committed in a time of weakness and temptation, when, “because
  of the abundance of revelation” and the unchecked flattery of a few imprudent admirers,
  he accepted greater praise than is due to any man. The Lord, however, brought him to a
  clear sight and sense of his error, and having heartily renounced and repented for all
  wrong, he was restored to fellowship and usefulness in the body of Christ for the
  remainder of his days.
