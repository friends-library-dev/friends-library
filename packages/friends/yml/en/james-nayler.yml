    text:
      When I came there, I found it was James Nayler preaching to the people; and with
      such power and reaching energy, as I had not till then been witness of. I could not
      help staying a little, although I was afraid to stay; for I was made a Quaker, being
      forced to tremble at the sight of myself. I was struck with more terror by the
      preaching of James Nayler, than I was at the battle of Dunbar, when we had nothing
      else to expect, but to fall a prey to the swords of our enemies, without being able
      to help ourselves. I clearly saw the cross to be submitted to, so I dared stay no
      longer, but got off, and carried condemnation for it in my own breast.

description:
  James Nayler was a prominent leader in the early Society of Friends in England. Though a
  farmer by trade, and a man of limited education, his deep spiritual understanding,
  piercing discernment, and powerful preaching of the gospel caused multitudes to
  acknowledge that he spoke in the demonstration of the Spirit and power, as one having
  authority, and not as the scribes. Sadly, he is best known for a single (and deeply
  regretted) act of folly committed in a time of weakness and temptation, when, “because
  of the abundance of revelation” and the unchecked flattery of a few imprudent admirers,
  he accepted greater praise than is due to any man. The Lord, however, brought him to a
  clear sight and sense of his error, and having heartily renounced and repented for all
  wrong, he was restored to fellowship and usefulness in the body of Christ for the
  remainder of his days.
