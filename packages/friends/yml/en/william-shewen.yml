description:
  William Shewen (1631–1695) was an early member of the Society of Friends who lived in
  London. He does not appear to have been a traveling minister in the society, but was a
  valuable author and a man known for his deep experience and understanding of both the
  work of God in the inner man and the attempts of Satan to hinder it. This publication,
  Meditations and Experiences, is a collection of paragraphs and short treatises, penned
  throughout Shewen's life, describing his own openings and experiences of important
  subjects such as the light of Christ, the kingdom of God, waiting upon the Lord, and
  overcoming fleshly thoughts and imaginations.
