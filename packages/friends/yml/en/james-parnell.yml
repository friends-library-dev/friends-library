name: James Parnell
slug: james-parnell
gender: male
description:
  James Parnell (1637-1656) is said to have been “young, small of stature, and poor in
  appearance, but thousands were obliged to confess that “he spoke as one having
  authority, and not as the scribes.” He was convinced of the Truth when a boy of fourteen
  years, and became a valiant minister of the gospel by sixteen. Following a debate with a
  prominent priest, Parnell was arrested on spurious charges of being an “idle and
  disorderly person,” and imprisoned at Colchester Castle. There he was confined to a
  small hole in the thick castle wall, twelve feet above the ground, and died from
  sickness and ill-treatment after ten months imprisonment at nineteen years of age.
