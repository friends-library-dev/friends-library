    text:
      And among these babes who thus came to receive a knowledge of the mysteries of the
      kingdom of God by the working of His divine power, was this noble child, James
      Parnell, who was a vessel of honor indeed, and mighty in the power and Spirit of
      Emmanuel. Much might be spoken of this young man, and a large testimony does live in
      my heart to his blessed life, and to the power and wisdom that abounded in him.

    text:
      Friend, stand in, and keep your mind to that which lets you see your enemies to be
      of your own house. Your imagination is an enemy; your wisdom is an enemy; that which
      has been precious to you is now your greatest enemy. Therefore, you must now
      sacrifice what you have called precious and yield it up to death, that the Just One
      may be raised to life, and the righteous Seed be brought forth to reign in you and
      be your Head.

description:
  James Parnell (1637-1656) is said to have been “young, small of stature, and poor in
  appearance, but thousands were obliged to confess that “he spoke as one having
  authority, and not as the scribes.” He was convinced of the Truth when a boy of fourteen
  years, and became a valiant minister of the gospel by sixteen. Following a debate with a
  prominent priest, Parnell was arrested on spurious charges of being an “idle and
  disorderly person,” and imprisoned at Colchester Castle. There he was confined to a
  small hole in the thick castle wall, twelve feet above the ground, and died from
  sickness and ill-treatment after ten months imprisonment at nineteen years of age.
