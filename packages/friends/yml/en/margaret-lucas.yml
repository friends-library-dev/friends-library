description:
  Margaret Lucas (1701-1769) was the youngest of fourteen children, and upon the death of
  her parents, was taken in and raised by her aunt and uncle. When about sixteen years of
  age, “upon a strict review” of herself, she concluded that she had “no evidence of the
  hope of eternal life abiding in her,” and so began to turn her mind to a more serious
  consideration of eternal things. Not finding peace or satisfaction in the ceremonies and
  opinions of the national church, she yearned for a true, inward acquaintance with the
  Spirit of God, and in time began to attend some meetings of the Society of Friends. But
  it soon became distressingly evident that following the voice of the Good Shepherd would
  cause her to be ridiculed by the world, and rejected and abused by her own family.
