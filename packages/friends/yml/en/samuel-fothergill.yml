    text:
      Here also, I met with Samuel Fothergill, then young in the ministry; but even then
      appearing with a solemnity, brightness, and gospel authority, which gave friends
      lively hopes of his proving, as he did, through the succeeding stages of his life, a
      bright and shining light, a vessel of honour indeed, of eminent service in the
      church of Christ.

    text:
      The passionate preacher has affected the passionate hearer; both have been in
      raptures, and neither of them edified. Mistake not the warmth of the passions for
      the gospel authority. The first is like the rattling thunder, which frights, but
      never hurts; the last is like the lightning from the east, which illuminates, and,
      at times, breaks through all opposition and melts every obstruction.

description:
  ​Samuel Fothergill (1715-1772) was the youngest son of eminent Quaker minister, John
  Fothergill. As a young man, Samuel yielded to various temptations, “giving way to the
  indulgence of his evil passions, and abandoning himself to the pursuit of folly and
  dissipation.” So great was his rebellion against the Truth, that his father, upon
  embarking on a long trip to America, took leave of him with these words—“And now, son
  Samuel, farewell!—farewell!; and unless it be as a changed man, I cannot say that I have
  any wish ever to see you again.” These words pierced Samuel’s heart, and were used of
  the Lord as a means to turn him to the path of repentance and conversion. Feeling the
  terrors of the Lord for sin, Samuel was made willing to abide under His righteous
  judgments, and so yielded to the transforming power of divine grace that, in time, he
  became one of the most distinguished and influential ministers of his day.

        description:
          Samuel Fothergill was the son of the well-known and much beloved minister of the
          gospel, John Fothergill. Some account of his father is prefixed to Samuel’s
          memoir, but “The Life and Letters of John Fothergill” has a larger
          autobiographical portion, and a sizable collection of letters to friends and
          epistles to churches.
