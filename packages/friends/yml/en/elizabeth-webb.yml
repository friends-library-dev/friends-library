description:
  Elizabeth Webb (1663-1726) was an early minister in the Society of Friends who travelled
  extensively in her service for the gospel. In the year 1712, while ministering in
  London, she became acquainted with Anthony William Boehm, then chaplain to Prince George
  of Denmark. At some point following their initial interview, Elizabeth Webb felt
  constrained in the love of God to write to Boehm and present him with the deeply
  instructive letter contained in this booklet, giving something of a summary of her
  spiritual pilgrimage.
