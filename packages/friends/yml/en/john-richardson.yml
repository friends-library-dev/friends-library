      I went to that dear ancient Friend John Richardsonâ€™s, who had been twice to America
      on religious visits, and had taken much pains in his day and time for the spreading
      and promoting the gospel of peace and salvation in the earth. Although he was
      ancient and feeble in body, he was fresh and green in the life of religion, and my
      heart was refreshed in the unity and fellowship of divine life, in being in his
      company.

      Next day I was at Castleton. I spent an hour with that emblem of innocence, and in
      the afternoon rode ten miles, to the house where the ark rests, i. e., John
      Richardson's, who went with me next day to Pickering, and I went back with him to
      his home, where we sat up until almost daylight.

description:
  The life of John Richardson (1667-1753) is a powerful confirmation of Jesus' words, that
  heavenly things "are hidden from the wise and prudent and revealed unto babes," and that
  His "power is made perfect in weakness." Though starting out in life a poor farm boy
  with little education, Richardson became a faithful student in the Holy Spirit's school
  of Christ, where he not only learned spiritual truths and heavenly mysteries, but came
  to experience his garments washed, his mind renewed, and his heart changed. Originally
  from England, he travelled as a minister for most of his adult life, twice visiting the
  American colonies, where he triumphantly defended the truth against "that sad apostate"
  George Keith.
