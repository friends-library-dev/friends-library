description:
  The life of John Richardson (1667-1753) is a powerful confirmation of Jesus' words, that
  heavenly things "are hidden from the wise and prudent and revealed unto babes," and that
  His "power is made perfect in weakness." Though starting out in life a poor farm boy
  with little education, Richardson became a faithful student in the Holy Spirit's school
  of Christ, where he not only learned spiritual truths and heavenly mysteries, but came
  to experience his garments washed, his mind renewed, and his heart changed. Originally
  from England, he travelled as a minister for most of his adult life, twice visiting the
  American colonies, where he triumphantly defended the truth against "that sad apostate"
  George Keith.
