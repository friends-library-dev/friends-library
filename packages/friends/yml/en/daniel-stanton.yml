    text:
      Soon after my return my mind was bowed very low, by reason that a beloved friend and
      father in the truth, Daniel Stanton, was taken from works to rewards. He had been
      eminently favoured in his public appearances for many months before, insomuch that
      many Friends were apprehensive of what he sometimes expressed as his belief, “that
      he had not many days longer to labour among us.” This was a great stripping to the
      church, and a near trial to many individuals, and the loss was not likely to be soon
      made up.

description:
  Daniel Stanton (1708-1770) was left an orphan when very young, and passed through great
  hardships in his early years. Being moved from place to place for short periods of time,
  he at last was put apprentice to his uncle in New Jersey, where he was allowed no
  freedom to attend any place of worship. But having a heart that longed for truth, the
  Lord was pleased to visit and instruct him by His own Holy Spirit, enabling him clearly
  to see that “those who worship Him, must worship in Spirit and truth.” Continuing in
  faithful resignation to whatever the Lord made manifest, Daniel became a minster of the
  gospel in the Society of Friends, and though his adult life was fraught with
  difficulties (having to bury his wife and five children before the age of forty), he
  overcame the world through a living faith and an unreserved surrender to the Lord Jesus
  Christ.
