      We found [Daniel Wheeler's] conversation truly edifying and interesting. He was all
      resignation under his trials&hellip; That which dropped from his own lips was
      heart-tendering, and abundantly satisfying. Oh! the dear servant of the Lord! He is
      as humble as a child; while capable of ascribing glory, and power, and dominion to
      the Lord God, and the Lamb that sitteth upon the throne.

      Daniel Wheeler had an excellent communication, in the course of which he said, "I
      have left all that is nearest and dearest to me in this world, to come among you,
      and willingly would I travel from east to west, and from north to south, old and
      gray-headed as I am, if I might be made instrumental in turning any of my
      fellow-mortals to the love of God."

description:
  The life of Daniel Wheeler (1771-1840) is a monument to the heart purifying power of the
  gospel of Jesus Christ. Left an orphan at a very young age, Wheeler was placed by a
  friend of the family as an apprentice on a sailing vessel where, along with learning
  sailing and navigation, he became acquainted with every form of vice and immorality.
  After six years in the navy, and another seven years in the army, the Lord made use of a
  hurricane at sea to awaken him to his lost condition. Being mercifully enabled to
  repent, and also to see the "entire spirituality of the Gospel dispensation," he soon
  left the army and joined the Society of Friends in London. His growth in grace was quick
  and steady, and after some years he became a minister of great esteem. When Emperor
  Alexander I of Russia requested the assistance of a Quaker farmer from England, Wheeler
  moved his family to near St. Petersburg, where they lived for for a number of lonely but
  heart-purifying years. Afterwards, he was led by the Lord to preach the gospel of Christ
  in a multitude of islands in the South Pacific Ocean.

          In 1824, Thomas Shillitoe went to St. Petersburg, Russia, and frequently
          attended the small meeting held in the home of his beloved friend Daniel
          Wheeler. After speaking with the emperor on more than one occasion, and
          surviving the historic flood of St. Petersburg that year, he and Daniel Wheeler
          traveled by land 1600 miles to Rotterdam, Holland.
