description:
  The life of Daniel Wheeler (1771-1840) is a monument to the heart purifying power of the
  gospel of Jesus Christ. Left an orphan at a very young age, Wheeler was placed by a
  friend of the family as an apprentice on a sailing vessel where, along with learning
  sailing and navigation, he became acquainted with every form of vice and immorality.
  After six years in the navy, and another seven years in the army, the Lord made use of a
  hurricane at sea to awaken him to his lost condition. Being mercifully enabled to
  repent, and also to see the "entire spirituality of the Gospel dispensation," he soon
  left the army and joined the Society of Friends in London. His growth in grace was quick
  and steady, and after some years he became a minister of great esteem. When Emperor
  Alexandar I of Russia requested the assistance of a Quaker farmer from England, Wheeler
  moved his family to near St. Petersburg, where they lived for for a number of lonely but
  heart-purifying years. Afterwards, he was led by the Lord to preach the gospel of Christ
  in a multitude of islands in the South Pacific Ocean.
