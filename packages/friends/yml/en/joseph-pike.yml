description:
  Joseph Pike (1657-1729) was convinced of the truth through the powerful preaching of
  William Edmundson, and grew to become a wise and faithful elder in the Society of
  Friends in Ireland. In his old age he wrote an account of his early years, spiritual
  struggles, and growth in the truth, chiefly for the benefit of his own children. In this
  short but valuable history, he relates (in helpful detail) the Lord's dealings to Him,
  first as a judge, then as a refiner of silver, and eventually as the comforter and
  strengthener of Zion.
