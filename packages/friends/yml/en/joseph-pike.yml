  - source: Joseph Pike
    text:
      “That which may be known of God, is manifest within man.” It is there that Christ
      teaches His people Himself. The more we keep inward to this school, the more we
      learn of Christ. The less we keep inward, even when involved in lawful things, the
      less we learn of Christ. Oh read, you that can read in the mystery of life! There is
      no safety, no preservation, no growing in the Truth, but in true humility, keeping
      inward to the gift of the Holy Spirit of Christ, continually watching in the light
      against the temptations of the enemy.

description:
  Joseph Pike (1657-1729) was convinced of the truth through the powerful preaching of
  William Edmundson, and grew to become a wise and faithful elder in the Society of
  Friends in Ireland. In his old age he wrote an account of his early years, spiritual
  struggles, and growth in the truth, chiefly for the benefit of his own children. In this
  short but valuable history, he relates (in helpful detail) the Lord's dealings to Him,
  first as a judge, then as a refiner of silver, and eventually as the comforter and
  strengthener of Zion.

        description:
          Towards the end of his life, Joseph Pike maintained an ongoing written
          correspondence with Deborah Bell, finding in her one who rightly discerned the
          condition of the church, and shared his burden to see all believers walk in a
          way that adorned the gospel of Christ.
