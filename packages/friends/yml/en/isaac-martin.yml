    text:
      Preaching, under the influence of the Holy Spirit, is good, and is a blessing to the
      church; but, I am persuaded, that if people generally were disposed to receive
      strength from the pure Fountain of everlasting love opened in their own hearts,
      there would be but little necessity for it.

description:
  ​Isaac Martin (1758-1828) was a sweet-spirited minister in the Society of Friends.
  Having fallen from a two-story window ​and cracked his skull when a small child, he
  suffered agonizing pain in his head and eye for the great majority of his life. But
  despite his frequent ailments, he submitted whole-heartedly to Christ's baptism of
  Spirit and fire, and became an effective minister who depended entirely upon the power
  and direction of the Holy Spirit. On this subject he once wrote - "Unless I had felt
  ​the Lord's​ blessed presence to strengthen and qualify me, I would rather have laid
  down my life, than have attempted to minister to the people by virtue of any ​knowledge
  or ability, natural or acquired, which, as a man, I might possess.​"​
