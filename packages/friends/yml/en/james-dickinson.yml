    text:
      It may be truly said of [James Dickinson] that he went not about to publish the
      gospel of life and salvation with enticing words which man's wisdom teaches, but in
      the power and demonstration of the Spirit. It was by being obedient to the powerful
      workings thereof in himself, and by waiting diligently for the movings and openings
      of it, that he became well qualified for that service.

  James Dickinson (1659-1741) was a well-known and much-beloved minister in the Society of
  Friends, whose long life was spent in tireless labor for the edification of the church
  and for the good of souls. In the service of the ministry, he travelled throughout
  England, Ireland, and Scotland; undergoing ​many ​sufferings in times of persecution. He
  visited Friends in Ireland twelve times, three times in America, once in Holland and
  ​also in ​Germany.​ ​His ministry was not in the enticing words which man’s wisdom
  teaches, but in the demonstration of the Spirit and power, and was effectual to the
  convincing and gathering of many whose hearts became settled on the Rock Christ Jesus,
  knowing Him to be their true light and teacher.
