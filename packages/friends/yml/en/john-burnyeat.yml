  John Burnyeat (1631-1690) was an elder and pillar in the early Society of Friends, whose
  powerful ministry turned many from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to the
  power of God. Having been awakened to see the fallacy of an imputed righteousness that
  is neither experienced nor obeyed, he turned to the One who struck him and found that
  Zion must be purged "by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning." Having
  been prepared and sent into harvest, he labored tirelessly and traveled extensively in
  the service of Truth, often suffering greatly for His faithfulness to Jesus Christ.
  Truly it can be said of John Burnyeat that he followed the Lord fully in his generation,
  putting his hand to the plow and never looking back.
