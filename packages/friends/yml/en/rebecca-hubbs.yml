description:
  It is said of Rebecca Hubbs (1772-1852), that though she was not highly educated or
  gifted for literary conversation, and though she had a very humble view of herself in
  every way, yet her ministry savored richly of the power of the anointing, conveyed "not
  in the words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Spirit teaches." Indeed, she
  was a clear instance of the Lord's power made perfect in weakness, and was used of the
  Lord in some remarkable ways, including a personal visit to president James Madison, to
  declare unto him the burden of word of the Lord that weighed heavily on her heart.
