      Set off for Woodbury, and called to see our aged friend Rebecca Hubbs; confined from
      the effects of paralysis. She is an extraordinary instance of the power of Divine
      grace, in preparing one of little knowledge, who has been faithful to its teachings,
      for usefulness in the church; and having received a gift in the ministry, enabling
      her at times to exercise it in an extraordinary manner.

description:
  It is said of Rebecca Hubbs (1772-1852), that though she was not highly educated or
  gifted for literary conversation, and though she had a very humble view of herself in
  every way, yet her ministry savored richly of the power of the anointing, conveyed "not
  in the words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Spirit teaches." Indeed, she
  was a clear instance of the Lord's power made perfect in weakness, and was used of the
  Lord in some remarkable ways, including a personal visit to president James Madison, to
  declare unto him the burden of word of the Lord that weighed heavily on her heart.

      A journal of the life of Rebecca Hubbs, showing how she was early awakened from the
      seductive vanities of time, willingly brought under the teaching and sanctifying
      power of grace, and made a worthy instrument in the Lord's hand for the promotion of
      His kingdom.
