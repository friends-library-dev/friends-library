    text:
      Dear John, indeed you are one of my dear and choice friends, who lie and live near
      me, and with whom is my dear, near, and inward fellowship. And though you say you
      are low and poor, and as dependent as ever, this is a noble condition, and nothing
      better could be said for yourself, or for the most worthy one in the flock. Oh dear
      John, I desire to dwell there too, while I live in this tabernacle.

description:
  John Gratton (1641-1711) was one of many early Quakers who were convinced of the truth
  directly by the Lord, apart from the preaching or writings of others in the Society of
  Friends. His desperate and agonizing pursuit of true Christianity (amongst the many
  sects and opinions of the day) finally brought him to dramatically experience the truth
  of Christ's promise--"Everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who
  knocks it will be opened." Having found the truth he had so diligently sought for, he
  loved it, and submitted to its powerful operations in his own heart, becoming an
  esteemed minister and a great sufferer for the gospel of Jesus Christ.
