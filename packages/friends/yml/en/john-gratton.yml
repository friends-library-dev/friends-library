description: John Gratton (1641-1711) was one of several early Quakers who were convinced of the truth directly by the Lord, apart from the preaching or writings of others in the Society. His desperate and agonizing pursuit of true Christianity (amongst the many sects and denominations of the day) finally brought him to dramatically experience the truth of Christ's promise—'Everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.'
