description:
  Elizabeth Stirredge (1634-1706) was not a traveling minister in the Society of Friends.
  She was a wife, a mother, and an extraordinary woman of God. This short but fascinating
  account of her life was written in the 56th year of her age for the benefit of her
  children and grandchildren. In it she describes her desperate search for the Lord in her
  younger days, her discovery of the Truth as it in Jesus, and many of the trials,
  persecutions, and deliverances she met with in the way, as she took up the daily cross
  and faithfully followed her Lord.
