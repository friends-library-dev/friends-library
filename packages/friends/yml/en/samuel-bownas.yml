description:
  As a young man, Samuel Bownas (1676-1753) was awakened to his lost condition through the
  powerful ministry of a young woman named Anne Wilson who, pointing to him in a meeting,
  told him he was but “a Quaker by tradition,” and a stranger to the transforming power of
  the gospel. Knowing this to be true, Bownas was cut to the quick, and so fervently
  turned to the Lord that both his heart and his conduct were greatly altered in a short
  time. Continuing in faithful submission to the Light of Christ, he became a minister and
  a sufferer for the gospel, traveling frequently in Great Britain and the American
  colonies, and being several times imprisoned for the testimony of Jesus Christ. Bownas
  was particularly conspicuous for his deep understanding concerning the work of the
  ministry, and became the author of a highly-regarded book entitled, “A Description of
  the Qualifications Necessary to a Gospel Minister.”
