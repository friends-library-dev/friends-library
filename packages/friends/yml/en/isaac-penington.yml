  - source: William Penn
    text:
      I may say [Isaac Penington] was one in a thousand; zealous, yet tender; wise, yet
      humble; a constant and early comer to meetings, and watchful and reverent in them.
      He was one that ever loved power and life more than words; and because he waited for
      this, so by it he would often be deeply affected and made to utter such testimonies
      as were greatly to the help of the poor and needy, the weary and heavy-laden, the
      true sojourners and travellers to the eternal rest and city of God.

    text:
      Yet after it pleased the Father to reveal his Son in [Isaac Penington], thereby
      giving him to see, and certainly to know, what was that good and acceptable and
      perfect will of God; oh, how joyfully did he receive it! How willingly did he bow
      unto it! How readily did he yield his neck to the yoke of Christ! And how constantly
      and delightfully did he wear it! Did he then regard the pleasures of the times, or
      value the preferments and honors of the world? No, no. he turned his back upon it
      all; esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt.

description:
  Isaac Penington (1616-1679) was the son of a prominent English politician, and the
  father-in-law of William Penn, founder of Pennsylvania. Though born into a family of
  wealth and reputation, Penington's heart was set upon things above from his earliest
  days. Even as a child, he recognized that the religion of his day stood in the will and
  understanding of man, in outward practices, duties, and scriptural truths that were
  professed but not truly possessed. Isaac Penington longed for more. Motivated by an
  insatiable hunger for truth, he sought the Lord with all his heart and discovered a
  Christianity that stood in, and flowed out from, the light and life of Jesus Christ
  reigning in the inner man.

      Isaac Penington (1616-1679) was the son of a prominent English politician, and the
      father-in-law of William Penn, founder of Pennsylvania. Though born into a family of
      wealth and reputation, Penington's heart was set upon things above from his earliest

      and understanding of man, in outward practices, duties, and scriptural truths that

      by an insatiable hunger for truth, he sought the Lord with all his heart and
      discovered a Christianity that stood in, and flowed out from, the light and life of

          'In her Lives and Persecutions of the Primitive Quakers, Mary Ann Kelty shows a
          particular affinity for the life and writings of Isaac Penington, saying of
          him:  "Yes, good and faithful servant!--well-instructed scribe!--bringing forth
          out of your treasures things new and old—-you have fed many! Be your just memory
          blessed! And let a heart that owes you much, thus, in most true and tender love,
          record its gratitude."'

          Knowing that Thomas Ellwood was reviled and abused by his father for his
          adherence to the Truth, Isaac and Mary Penington took him into their home and
          treated him as on of their own children. Much of the biographical information
          that is known about the Peningtons comes from the Journal of Thomas Ellwood.

    description:
      Isaac Penington (1616-1679) was the son of a prominent English politician, and the
      father-in-law of William Penn, founder of Pennsylvania. Though born into a family of
      wealth and reputation, Penington's heart was set upon things above from his earliest
      days. Even as a child, he recognized that the religion of his day stood in the will
      and understanding of man, in outward practices, duties, and scriptural truths that
      were professed but not truly possessed. Motivated by an insatiable hunger for truth,
      he sought the Lord with all his heart and was shown a Christianity that stood in,
      and flowed out from, the light and life of Jesus Christ reigning in the inner man.
      The Works of Isaac Penington (in four volumes) available through Friends Library
      Publishing are his unabridged works, which have not been edited, with the exception
      of some modernization of archaic words and spellings.
