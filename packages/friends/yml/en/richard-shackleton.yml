description:
  Richard Shackleton (1726-1792) was the son of the beloved and brilliant elder in the
  Society of Friends, Abraham Shackleton, who founded a prominent boarding school in
  Ballitore, Ireland, in 1726. Like his father, Richard was endowed with uncommon
  intellectual and literary giftings, and there was no art or science at which he did not
  excel. But finding no true satisfaction in anything outside of the presence and power of
  his God, he brought both his will and his intellect under the yoke of the cross, and so
  became a fruitful branch in the church of Christ, and an “elder worthy of double honor.”
  Neither he nor his wife Elizabeth (1726-1804) were ministers in the Society of Friends,
  but their deep humility, spiritual wisdom, and unaffected virtue shined conspicuously in
  all that they did, and made them preachers of righteousness wherever they were.
