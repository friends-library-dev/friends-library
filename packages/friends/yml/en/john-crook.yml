    text:
      This Holy Spirit has been to me both meat and drink, even as the Rock of old that
      followed the Israelites. Ten times (as I remember) I have been in bonds, and all for
      the sake of a good conscience before my God. But this Holy Spirit never left me, but
      many times has caused me to sing in prisons. Yes, by this Holy Spirit all has turned
      to my joy. My help is in it, my comfort flows from it, and my daily request to my
      God is that all His people may be guided by it in all things.

description:
  Like many other early Quakers, John Crook (1617-1699) was a seeker of truth from his
  earliest days. He was educated in London, and for a time held the office of Justice of
  the Peace in Bedfordshire, but when he was convinced of the truth in 1654 by the
  preaching of William Dewsbury, he soon lost both his public office and his freedom. In
  all, John Crook was imprisoned ten times for his faith, and suffered greatly at "the
  hands of unreasonable men."
