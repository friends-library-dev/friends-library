description:
  ​John Churchman (1705-1775) was a man whose entire life was devoted to the increase of
  Christ's kingdom in the hearts of men. Having experienced the spiritual baptism which
  saves, and abiding in a state of watchfulness and humility, he grew from stature to
  stature and became an upright minister and father in the church, traveling diligently in
  the work of the ministry as an example to all in word, conduct, faith and ​love. Three
  days before his death, though weak and unable to stand on his own, he said to those
  standing by his bedside, "I feel more life, more light, more love and sweetness than
  ever before," and then speaking more of the divine refreshment and comfort he felt
  flowing like a pure stream to his inward man, he said, "I feel that which lives beyond
  death and the grave."
