      We were met here by our worthy friend, that good man, John Churchman, an eminent
      minister of the Gospel, whose services are well known to many in England, Wales,
      Scotland, Ireland, Holland, Germany, etc.; his labour was great, instructing,
      convincing, and edifying to many, by whom he is had in sweet remembrance.

description:
  ​John Churchman (1705-1775) was a man whose entire life was devoted to the increase of
  Christ's kingdom in the hearts of men. Having experienced the spiritual baptism which
  saves, and abiding in a state of watchfulness and humility, he grew from stature to
  stature and became an upright minister and father in the church, traveling diligently in
  the work of the ministry as an example to all in word, conduct, faith and ​love. Three
  days before his death, though weak and unable to stand on his own, he said to those
  standing by his bedside, "I feel more life, more light, more love and sweetness than
  ever before," and then speaking more of the divine refreshment and comfort he felt
  flowing like a pure stream to his inward man, he said, "I feel that which lives beyond
  death and the grave."

        description:
          In 1750, John Pemberton crossed the Atlantic intending to spend time in Europe
          for purposes of business and for the benefit of his health. But finding his
          heart nearly attached to his fellow-passanger, John Churchman, he "found no
          liberty to leave him," and spent the next three years travelling with him
          throughout Europe in the work of the ministry.
