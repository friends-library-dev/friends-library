quotes:
  - source: Francis Howgill
    text:
      I have sought the way of the Lord from a child, and lived innocently as among men;
      and if any inquire concerning my latter end, let them know that I die in the faith
      in which I lived, and suffered for.
  - source: George Fox
    text:
      And though his blood does cry out for vengeance, yet he could say "the Lord forgive
      all my persecutors;" for having the mind of Christ, he desired the good of all, yes
      even the worst of his enemies, and in that desire for the good of all he did labor
      and travail, seeking their good and their eternal welfare in the inheritance of
      life.

description:
  Francis Howgill (1618-1669), received a university education to become a minister in the
  Episcopal church. However, being dissatisfied with the superstition which he saw
  remaining in it, he soon left it, joining himself to the Independents, and then to the
  Anabaptists, desperately seeking the true spiritual life that his soul thirsted after.
  At length, being mightily affected by the ministry of George Fox, he joined the
  persecuted society called Quakers, among whom he became a widely respected member and
  evangelist. He died in prison for his testimony to the truth, leaving behind many
  influential books and letters.

    description:
      Francis Howgill (1618–1668) was a valiant minister of the gospel in the early
      Society of Friends in England who suffered great persecution and eventually died in
      prison for “the Word of God and for the testimony of Jesus.” This short book
      contains a remarkable explanation of the Day of the Lord, and a powerful description
      of the Holy Spirit’s work in the heart of man.
