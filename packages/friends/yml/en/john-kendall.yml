description:
  John Kendall (1726-1815) lived a long and fruitful life in the service of his Master.
  Through submission to pious parents, he learned to walk in the narrow and safe path when
  still very young, and was called to the work of the ministry in his twenty-first year.
  His travels for the Lord were first in the northern parts of England and Scotland, but
  in subsequent years he made five trips to Holland, one to Germany, and was often engaged
  in gospel labors in Great Britain. When older and less able to travel, much of his time
  was dedicated to the publication of valuable Christian writings, some written by
  himself, and some collected and compiled from other pious authors.

    description:
      Kendall’s Collection of Letters is a complication of letters composed by various
      members of the Society of Friends over the course of several decades. A few of the
      letters may have been addressed to John Kendall himself, but the great majority were
      written to other recipients, and were later collected and published by Kendall in
      1802, after the decease of their authors. Two lengthy sections of this publication
      are taken exclusively from the letters of that truly wise and devoted man, Richard
      Shackleton. But there are letters from many other eminent Friends as well, including
      Catherine Payton, Samuel Fothergill, Sophia Hume, Tabitha Ecroyd, Mary Peisley, John
      Woolman, and many more.
