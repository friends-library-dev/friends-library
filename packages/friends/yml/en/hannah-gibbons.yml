      The faculties of our aged friend [Hanna Gibbons, at 81 years of age] are remarkably
      preserved; the staidness and solidity of her spirit are peculiar, and the constant
      exercise of her mind, trained in the school of Christ and ornamented with the
      garment of humility, makes her a striking example; showing the efficacy of Divine
      grace, and the fruits of long dedication to her Lord in the path of self-denial and
      daily watchfulness unto prayer. We felt nearly united to her, and esteemed it a
      favor to have such a pillar and watch-woman continued in the militant church, to so
      late a period of life.

      On the day following, we visited dear Hannah Gibbons, who was in her ninety-fifth
      year. Truly it was a strengthening, encouraging visit to my mind. She was lively and
      green in old age, remembered her visit to Ohio made in her eightieth year, and could
      recollect much that was said and done in our Yearly Meeting at that time.

  Hannah Gibbons (1771-1868) was a meek but truly living minister in the later period of
  the Society of Friends. Though she forever maintained a low view of herself and her
  spiritual attainments, she was considered by all to be a pillar in church, traveling in
  the capacity of a minister well into her eighties, and often being led of the Lord, in
  old age, to visit hardened prisoners who were condemned to death. She remained
  spiritually green and fruitful to the very end of her life, and died with a heart full
  of life, wisdom, and deep spiritual experience at 97 years of age.

        description:
          On many occasions throughout his journal, William Evans mentions his great
          respect and loving regard for that "mother in our Israel", Hannah Gibbons. A
          letter of hers was included by Evans in his journal, which appears to have been
          a great source of encouragement to him during a difficult time.
