description:
  Hannah Gibbons (1771-1868) was a meek but truly living minister in the later period of
  the Society of Friends. Though she forever maintained a low view of herself and her
  spiritual attainments, she was considered by all to be a pillar in church, traveling in
  the capacity of a minister well into her eighties, and often being led of the Lord, in
  old age, to visit hardened prisoners who were condemend to death. She remained
  spiritually green and fruitful to the very end of her life, and died with a heart full
  of life, wisdom, and deep spiritual experience at 97 years of age.
