description:
  George Whitehead (1636-1723) was one of the most well-known and influential ministers in
  the early Society of Friends. He was convinced of the Truth when only 17 years old, and
  through faithfulness grew quickly in the life and power of Christ. In his services for
  the gospel he was frequently abused and persecuted by unreasonable and wicked men. He
  was imprisoned many times and once publicly whipped for his testimony to the Truth, but
  through all he clung to the cross, and became a pillar and elder in the church of God,
  constantly laboring for the advancement of Truth and many times appearing before kings
  and magistrates to plead the cause of his persecuted brethren.
