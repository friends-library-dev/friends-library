description:
  Thomas Scattergood (1748 - 1814) was a minister in the Society of Friends who knew what
  it meant to be “in deaths often”, to be brought very low after seasons of divine favor,
  and often to partake (according to his measure) of that bitter cup which was drunk in
  its fullness by his Lord and Savior. But these seasons of conflict and suffering
  (frequently mentioned in his journal) were clearly blessed to him, both as a means of
  personal preservation from the snares of the enemy, and of preparing him to minister in
  extraordinary power and authority in the presence of multitudes. Few persons, it is
  believed, were preserved more steadily in a state of inward exercise and retirement of
  spirit, waiting on the Lord, or given to see more clearly, or to minister more
  pertinently to, the states of meetings and individuals. And though he always maintained
  a low opinion of himself, and spoke rarely and diffidently of the fruits of his
  ministry, few have left behind them more seals to the baptizing and convincing power of
  their gospel ministry.
