      My uncle Thomas Scattergood…was not only remarkable for the gift of the ministry of
      the gospel of life and salvation, but also for the spirit of prophecy, with which he
      was at times clearly endowed, and under which he often foretold coming events; being
      a man who lived in the Spirit and walked in the Spirit, and to whom the Lord
      condescended to make known his secrets relating to the spiritual condition of
      others, and of his works among the children of men.

      Spent some time this evening reading in the Journal of Thomas Scattergood; and it is
      renewedly sealed upon my mind that the great exercise and travail of soul that he
      passed though in England and America, in his ministerial labors, were designed as a
      particular call and warning to those amongst us in the ministry, not to trust to, or
      lean to our own understandings in our religious movements. Oh! how abased, how shut
      up, how exceedingly stripped, tried and tempted, did our Heavenly Father permit him
      to become, not only for a day or a month, but for months together!

description:
  Thomas Scattergood (1748 - 1814) was a minister in the Society of Friends who knew what
  it meant to be “in deaths often,” to be “hard-pressed on every side, yet not crushed;
  perplexed but not in despair.” But his many seasons of conflict and suffering were
  clearly made a blessing to him, both as a means of personal preservation from the snares
  of the enemy, and of preparing him to minister in remarkable power and authority in the
  presence of large assemblies. Few persons, it is believed, were preserved more steadily
  in a state of inward watchfulness and retirement of spirit, waiting upon the Lord. And
  few were enabled to see more clearly, or to minister more pertinently to the states of
  meetings and individuals. Though he always maintained a low opinion of himself, and
  spoke rarely and diffidently of the fruits of his ministry, all who knew him heartily
  testified to the baptizing and convincing power of his gospel labors.

        description:
          The name Rebecca Jones appears many times throughout the journal of Thomas
          Scattergood, and it is clear that she played a vital role in his life, both as
          an intimate friend and sister in the faith, and an encourager in the work of the
          ministry. It was Rebecca Jones (when bedridden with the Yellow Fever) who
          confirmed Scattergood’s call to “go over the great waters” to minister to the
          church in Europe.
