description:
  Thomas Scattergood (1748 - 1814) was a minister in the Society of Friends who knew what
  it meant to be “in deaths often”, to be "hard-pressed on every side, yet not crushed;
  perplexed but not in dispair." But his many seasons of conflict and suffering were
  clearly made a blessing to him, both as a means of personal preservation from the snares
  of the enemy, and of preparing him to minister in remarkable power and authority in the
  presence of large assemblies. Few persons, it is believed, were preserved more steadily
  in a state of inward watchfulness and retirement of spirit, waiting upon the Lord. And
  few were enabled to see more clearly, or to minister more pertinently to the states of
  meetings and individuals. Though he always maintained a low opinion of himself, and
  spoke rarely and diffidently of the fruits of his ministry, all who knew him heartily
  testified to the baptizing and convincing power of his gospel labors.
