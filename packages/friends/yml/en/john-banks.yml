    text:
      He [John Banks] was a means of strength to my soul in the early days of my
      convincement. I was kindly encouraged by him in the belief of the blessed doctrine
      of the light, spirit, grace, and truth of Christ in the inward parts, reproving,
      instructing, reforming, and redeeming those souls from the evil of the world, who
      were obedient thereunto.

    text:
      It is well with me. I have nothing to do but to die, and I shall end in the Truth as
      I began.

description:
  John Banks (1637-1710) was faithful and influential minister among the first generation
  of Quakers. Upon his death, an intimate friend wrote of him--"After it had pleased the
  eternal, wise God to open his understanding, and to let him see his own state and
  condition, and reveal his Son in him, he was made willing to give up freely to the
  heavenly and inward appearance of Christ Jesus, the hope of glory. And as he was
  obedient thereunto, he was entrusted with a large gift of the ministry, in which he
  grew, and was made powerful in it, to the turning of many unto the right way of the Lord
  who were convinced of the evil of their ways, and turned unto Jesus Christ, their free
  Teacher, and were made to bless the Lord on his behalf."
