description:
  The short life of Mary Ann Gilpin (1813-1838) is a beautiful and compelling testimony to
  the powerful operation of the Spirit of Truth upon any heart that is “humble, contrite,
  and trembles at His Word.” Bowing her neck to the yoke of Christ at a young age, this
  extraordinary young woman was led step by step through the wilderness of this world,
  through great losses and painful trials, unto a true growth in grace and a steadfastness
  in faith. She finished her race in her 25th year, having fought the good fight, kept the
  faith, and left behind her an “aroma of life”--the sweet fragrance of the knowledge of
  her Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
