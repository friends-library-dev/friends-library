description:
  David Ferris (1707-1779) was favored as a young child with a merciful visitation of the
  Lord whereby he was called out of the vanities of the world and enabled to see through
  the empty forms and superstitions of man-made religion. He was brought up a Presbyterian
  and educated in their way, but by attending to the inward teachings of divine grace, he
  became convinced of the principles of Friends (having no outward knowledge of their
  doctrines or practices). Being timid and diffident by nature, he resisted the Lord’s
  call to ministry for many years, but at length gave up to preach the gospel and travel
  in the Lord's service.
