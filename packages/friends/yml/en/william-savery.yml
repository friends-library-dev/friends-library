    text:
      I was intimately acquainted with William Savery, and esteemed him as a brother
      beloved. His submission to the power of Divine love in his own heart, by which he
      was brought out of sin and corruption, and his indefatigable devotion to the cause
      of Christ, present an instructive example, calculated to invite old and young to
      diligence and faithfulness in the path of manifested duty.

    text:
      William Savery closed the meeting in solemn prayer, in which I united with tears,
      and perhaps I never felt greater love for him at any time in my life than in this
      meeting. I spent the evening with him, and took an affectionate farewell; and this
      was the language of my soul when I left him; O Fountain of mercy, be with my dear
      fellow servant, and safely waft him over the great deep to his family and friends in
      peace.

description:
  Though raised by godly parents, William Savery (1750-1804) turned aside from the path of
  peace and joined in company with vain and careless youth until the twenty-eighth year of
  his age. But finding his heart pierced by conviction at a meeting of Friends, he was so
  deeply affected that he quickly and permanently turned his back upon the world and its
  ways. Committing himself entirely to teachings of the Spirit of Truth, and seeking to
  live in steady subjection to the cross, he soon felt a call to preach the gospel both on
  the continent of North America and in many places in Europe. He was also a great
  advocate for the Native Americans, sometimes accompanying them in their treaties and
  negotiations with the United States government, doing all in his power to ensure that
  they were not misled or mistreated.
