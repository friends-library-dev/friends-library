description:
  Though raised by godly parents, William Savery (1750-1804) turned aside from the path of
  peace and joined in company with vain and careless youth until the twenty-eighth year of
  his age. But finding his heart pierced by conviction at a meeting of Friends, he was so
  deeply affected that he quickly and permanently turned his back upon the world and its
  ways. Committing himself entirely to teachings of the Spirit of Truth, and seeking to
  live in steady subjection to the cross, he soon felt a call to preach the gospel both on
  the continent of North America and in many places in Europe. He was also a great
  advocate for the Native Americans, sometimes accompanying them in their treaties and
  negotiations with the United States government, doing all in his power to ensure that
  they were not misled or mistreated.
