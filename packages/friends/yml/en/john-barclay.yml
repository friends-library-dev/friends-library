description:
  Although John Barclay (1797-1838) was a descendent of the well-known apologist Robert
  Barclay, he was a complete stranger to the life and power of Truth until he began to
  seek the Lord with all his heart, somewhere around his 18th year. The Society of Friends
  at that time was in a low and declining state, but John Barclay dug deep and found the
  Root of life from which the early Quakers had sprouted, and in time became a living
  branch himself, and a very useful author and minister. He lived only 41 years, but his
  short life was wholly dedicated to his Master's cause, and many of the journals,
  memoirs, and biographies of Early Friends that we possess now are the fruit of his
  arduous and faithful labor with the original documents.
