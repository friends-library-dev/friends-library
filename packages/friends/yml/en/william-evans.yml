description:
  William Evans (1787-1867) was one of the last spiritually living and weighty ministers
  amidst a greatly divided and quickly vanishing Society of Friends. His journal is
  remarkable for its deeply personal style, and its valuable and enlightening comments on
  Scripture, the church, the operation of grace in the soul, ministry, and many other
  important subjects. Evans witnessed and stood against the two unhappy divisions that
  greatly crippled the Society in the first half of the 19th century (the Hicksite and
  Gurneyite separations), contending earnestly for the original principles and practices
  of Friends. William and his brother Thomas were the editors and publishers of the
  original Friends' Library, as well as an updated version of the four-volume work
  entitled Piety Promoted.
