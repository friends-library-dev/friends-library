    text:
      He whom my soul sought above all things suddenly came to His temple, and by His Holy
      Spirit gave me to see that He alone is the author of that faith which enters within
      the veil and gives victory over the world, the flesh, and the devil; and that it is
      not founded merely on what is read, but is really “of the operation of God” on the
      heart.

description:
  William Evans (1787-1867) was one of the last spiritually living and weighty ministers
  amidst a greatly divided and quickly vanishing Society of Friends. His journal is
  remarkable for its deeply personal style, and its valuable and enlightening comments on
  Scripture, the church, the operation of grace in the soul, ministry, and many other
  important subjects. Evans witnessed and stood against the two unhappy divisions that
  greatly crippled the Society in the first half of the 19th century (the Hicksite and
  Gurneyite separations), contending earnestly for the original principles and practices
  of Friends. William and his brother Thomas were the editors and publishers of the
  original Friends’ Library, as well as an updated version of the four-volume work
  entitled Piety Promoted.

          Hanna Gibbons was an intimate friend of both William and Elizabeth Evans. Her
          journal frequently mentions “the humble walk and solid deportment” of this godly
          couple, and several letters to William are published among her papers.
