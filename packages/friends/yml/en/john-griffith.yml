  - source: John Griffith
    text:
      Very gross is the deception of those who imagine the whole work of regeneration to
      be instantaneous. This can be nothing else but a delusion of Satan, to settle people
      at rest in a state of self-security as soon as he can. Oh! what a length of time it
      takes to work out that rebellious, stiff-necked, backsliding nature, which was born
      in Egypt, before the new generation is raised up that is fit to enter the promised
      land!

description:
  From a wild and thoughtless youth, John Griffith (1713-1776) was made a wise and careful
  minister of the gospel. His journal is filled with heavenly wisdom gained from personal
  experience of both the Lord’s goodness and guidance, and the enemy’s snares and
  deceptions. Together with a remnant of bright, shining lamps in his generation, Griffith
  warred against a sad degeneracy into formality, tradition, and lifeless words amongst a
  people once distinguished by their adherence to the inward power and purity of the Holy
  Spirit. Doubtless his life and experiences will be read with great interest by every
  sincere seeker of God.
