description:
  From a wild and thoughtless youth, John Griffith (1713-1776) was made a wise and careful
  minister of the gospel. His journal is filled with heavenly wisdom gained from personal
  experience of both the Lord's goodness and guidance, and the enemy's snares and
  deceptions. Together with a remnant of bright, shining lamps in his generation, Griffith
  warred against a sad degeneracy into formality, tradition, and lifeless words amongst a
  people once distinguished by their adherence to the inward power and purity of the Holy
  Spirit. Doubtless his life and experiences will be read with great interest by every
  sincere seeker of God.
