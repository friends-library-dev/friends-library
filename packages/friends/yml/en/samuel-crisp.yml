  - source: Samuel Bownas
    text:
      I set out, having in company a young man who had been bred at college, whose name
      was Samuel Crisp; a meek spirited youth, having received the knowledge of the truth
      the right way.

  - city: London
    region: England
description:
  Samuel Crisp (1670—1704) was a brilliant young priest in the Church of England whose
  hunger for truth and righteousness led him to leave off all formal, shadowy religion and
  join with the despised people called Quakers to worship God in spirit and truth. This
  short document consists chiefly of two letters written by Crisp explaining his reasons
  for leaving the national worship, and describing how the Lord revealed His Son in him,
  “at the brightness of whose appearance the clouds are scattered and the shadows flee
  away.”
