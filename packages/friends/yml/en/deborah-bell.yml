          Towards the end of his life, the valuable elder Joseph Pike maintained an
          ongoing written correspondence with Deborah Bell, finding in her one who rightly
          discerned the condition of the church, and shared his burden to see all
          believers walk in a way that adorned the gospel of Christ.
