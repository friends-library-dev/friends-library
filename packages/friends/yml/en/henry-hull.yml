description:
  Henry Hull (1765-1834) loved the Lord from a young age and desired to serve Him, but
  being diffident and shy by nature, was unwilling to give up to a call to the ministry
  until a voice sounded in the ear of his understanding, saying, “You are in great danger
  of being lost in your rebellion.” At that moment, Henry put his hand to the plow and
  never looked back, saying, “Lord, do what You will with me, come life or death, I will
  give up all for Your sake.” He travelled much in the ministry in different parts of the
  United States, Canada, Ireland, and England, and though he met with a severe trial in
  the loss of his wife, son, and mother to a malignant fever, he was nevertheless enabled
  to say, “Though He slay me, yet I will trust in Him. It is the Lord, let Him do what
  seems good to Him.”
