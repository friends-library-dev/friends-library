description:
  Richard Jordan (1756-1826) was awakened by a tenderizing visitation of the Holy Spirit
  when only twelve years old, and enabled to surrender himself entirely to the
  transforming and refining baptism of Jesus Christ. He was called to preach the gospel
  when twenty-five years of age, but for a long time his appearances in the ministry were
  short and infrequent, feeling a dread lest he should "shoot out into the branches"
  without first knowing "an establishment in the Root of immortal life." Being faithful in
  the little, his gift in the ministry grew, and he became one who preached in the
  demonstration of the Spirit and of power, clearly opening to individuals their states
  and conditions, and inviting all to peace with God through the effectual operation of
  the cross of Jesus Christ.
