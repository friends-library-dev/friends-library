description:
  William Edmundson (1627—1712) is generally considered to be both the first and the most
  distinguished member of Society of Friends in Ireland. He was convinced of the truth in
  1653 by the powerful preaching of James Nayler, and spent over 50 years traveling and
  suffering for its promotion in the earth. Before the Lord he was meek and submissive,
  but before the enemies of truth he was as bold as a lion, fearlessly "manifesting the
  truth to every man's conscience in the sight of God." His life was fraught with
  persecutions and prisons, being often reviled and abused for his obedience to Christ.
  But through all he remained faithful, and was preserved in strength of body and mind to
  a good old age, tirelessly serving the church and bearing much fruit to the end of his
  days.
