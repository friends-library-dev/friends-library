description:
  Christopher Healy (1773-1851) joined the Society of Friends when 19 years old, and being
  faithful in the “day of small things,” grew strong in the grace of God and in the
  knowledge of Jesus Christ. He became an eminent minister of the gospel during the sad
  time of declension and division in the mid 1800’s. When many nominal Quakers were
  departing to the right and to the left, Christopher Healy was among the few who kept to
  the ancient path and “contended earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered
  to the saints.”
