      About this time I read Sewel’s “History of the Quakers,” which I think removed every
      objection, and confirmed me in my opinion of the truth of their principles. Their
      severe sufferings, their patience under them, and honest boldness before kings and
      rulers, convinced me that nothing but a divine power could have supported them.

  William Sewel (1653-1720), being a Quaker himself, an honest and meticulous researcher,
  and an eye-witness to many of the events described in his writings, has long been
  considered the foremost authority on the early history of the Society of Friends. This
  lengthy but invaluable publication (first written in Dutch in 1717, and then translated
  by Sewel into English) tells the truly amazing story of a people who awoke from the
  lifeless and formal religion of their day, submitted whole-heartedly to the teachings of
  the Spirit of truth, and so returned to the original life, light, power, and purity of
  primitive Christianity.

    description:
      Catherine Evans (1618-1692) and Sarah Cheevers (1608-1664) were early ministers in
      the Society of Friends who embarked together on a missionary journey, intending for
      Alexandria, Egypt. After enduring several storms, their ship stopped at Malta, an
      island in the Mediterranean then under the dominion of the Catholic Church. Evans
      and Cheevers were arrested on the island for preaching and handing out books and
      were placed under house arrest. After three months, they were moved to a local
      prison where they endured nearly four years of cruel treatment at the hands of the
      Inquisition in attempting to force their conversion to Catholicism.
