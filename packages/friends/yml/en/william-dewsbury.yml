description:
  William Dewsbury (1621-1688) was an eminent minister and elder in the early Society of
  Friends whose role in the formation and oversight of the Society was comparable to that
  of George Fox. Like many others in is day, Dewsbury suffered great persecution for the
  testimony of Jesus Christ, but never played the coward in the face of adversity.
  Speaking of his nineteen years of wrongful imprisonment, he declared, "I joyfully
  entered prisons as palaces and sang praises to my God, esteeming the bolts and locks put
  upon me as jewels." After visiting William Dewsbury in 1676, John Whiting described him
  as "an extraordinary man in many ways, and I thought, as exact a pattern of a perfect
  man as I ever knew."
