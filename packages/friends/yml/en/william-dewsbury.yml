    text:
      William Dewsbury then dwelt in his own hired house, with whom I had pretty much
      discourse in his garden of many things to my great comfort and satisfaction; for he
      was very free and open to me beyond what I could expect, being a young man and a
      stranger outwardly to him. He told me some things I shall never forget. He was an
      extraordinary man in many ways, and I thought, as exact a pattern of a perfect man
      as I ever knew.

    text:
      I joyfully entered prisons as palaces and sang praises to my God, esteeming the
      bolts and locks put upon me as jewels.

description:
  William Dewsbury (1621-1688) was an eminent minister and elder in the early Society of
  Friends whose role in the formation and oversight of the Society was comparable to that
  of George Fox. Like many others in his day, Dewsbury suffered great persecution for the
  testimony of Jesus Christ, but never played the coward in the face of adversity.
  Speaking of his nineteen years of wrongful imprisonment, he declared, “I joyfully
  entered prisons as palaces and sang praises to my God, esteeming the bolts and locks put
  upon me as jewels.” After visiting William Dewsbury in 1676, John Whiting described him
  as “an extraordinary man in many ways, and I thought, as exact a pattern of a perfect
  man as I ever knew.”
