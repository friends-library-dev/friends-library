description:
  Before Mary Alexander (1760-1809) had attained to the age of seventeen years, she was
  impressed with a strong apprehension that, if faithful to the manifestations of the Holy
  Spirit, she would be called to the work of the ministry. But having a low opinion of
  herself, and feeling entirely unprepared for so important a work, she was for many years
  reluctant to give up to the Lord’s clear leading. However, finding His Word in her heart
  to “like a burning fire shut up in her bones,” she at last yielded to His call and began
  traveling and preaching throughout England, Scotland, and Wales as the Lord gave her
  utterance. Mary Alexander was known to be a woman of deep humility and uncommon
  spiritual understanding, and one whose life was unreservedly dedicated to her Master’s
  cause.
