description:
  Thomas Story (1662-1742) was an extremely gifted and serviceable minister in the Society
  of Friends, who traveled all over England, Ireland, Scotland, Holland, Jamaica,
  Barbados, and the American colonies in his service for the gospel. He was well-known for
  both his spiritual depth and his intellectual genius. His clear perception of spiritual
  truth, profound knowledge of Scripture, and facility of expression made him more than a
  match for the enemies of truth who attempted to slander and oppose the teachings of
  early Friends. The many compelling doctrinal arguments found in his journal became very
  influential among Quakers, and will still be read with great benefit by every genuine
  seeker of truth.
