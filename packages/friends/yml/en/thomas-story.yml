    text:
      But, as the diadem of all, and the only true and certain way, when it pleased the
      Most High (by the effusion of His own goodness) to reveal in me the Son of His love,
      even His wisdom and power, by whom He designed and effected all things, then I was
      taught to fear Him; then I was taught to love him; then, and not rightly till then,
      was my soul instructed and informed indeed.

description:
  Thomas Story (1662-1742) was an extremely gifted and serviceable minister in the Society
  of Friends, who traveled all over England, Ireland, Scotland, Holland, Jamaica,
  Barbados, and the American colonies in his service for the gospel. He was well-known for
  both his spiritual depth and his intellectual genius. His clear perception of spiritual
  truth, profound knowledge of Scripture, and facility of expression made him more than a
  match for the enemies of truth who attempted to slander and oppose the teachings of
  early Friends. The many compelling doctrinal arguments found in his journal became very
  influential among Quakers, and will still be read with great benefit by every genuine
  seeker of truth.

      A selection from the journal of Thomas Story, giving an account of his dramatic
      awakening to the truth apart from any human agency, and his subsequent usefulness in
      the church as a minister of the gospel, being one in whom there was an unusual
      combination of child-like humility and extraordinary intellectual discernment.
