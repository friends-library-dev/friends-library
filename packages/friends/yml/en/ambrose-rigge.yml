description:
  Ambrose Rigge (1635-1705) was early convinced of the truth through the preaching of
  George Fox, and grew to be a powerful minister of the gospel, a faithful elder, and a
  great sufferer for the cause of Christ. In one of his letters, he writes, "I have been
  in eleven prisons in this county, one of which held me ten years, four months and
  upward, besides twice premunired, and once publicly lashed, and many other sufferings
  too long to relate here." Yet through all he kept the faith, and served the Lord's body
  even while in bonds, through letters and papers given to encourage and establish the
  flock. Ambrose Rigge was one of many in his generation who sold all to buy the Pearl of
  great price, and having found true treasure, he kept it till the end.
