      I am ready to conclude that no one in our day, from the time of the effectual
      visitation of Christ in her soul, adhered with more steadiness to His guidance,
      through a variety of probations.

    text:
      I know there is a kingdom of heaven, because I already feel it within me,—Christ in
      me, as said the apostle, the hope of glory; and because He lives, I live also; not
      merely an animal life which must perish, but a life hid with Christ in God.

description:
  Mary Neale (1717-1757), dying suddenly only three days after her marriage to Samuel
  Neale, is best known by her maiden name, Mary Peisley. Having been early turned from the
  pursuit of worldly pleasures and vanities by the inward appearing of the Lord Jesus,
  Mary Neale surrendered all to the cross of Christ and was made by Him a shining example
  of a true gospel minister. Of her life, James Gough (another highly esteemed minister in
  the Society of Friends) wrote, “I am ready to conclude that no one in our day, from the
  time of the effectual visitation of Christ in her soul, adhered with more steadiness to
  His guidance, through a variety of probations.”

        description:
          Mary Peisley and Catherine Payton were companions together in the bonds of the
          gospel, and their unity in the living Truth was strong and deep. They often
          travelled together in the work of the ministry, and were considered by many to
          be two of the most eminent ministers of their time.
