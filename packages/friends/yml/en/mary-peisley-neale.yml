gender: female
description:
  Mary Neale (1717-1757), dying suddenly only three days after her marriage to Samuel
  Neale, is best known by her maiden name, Mary Peisley. Having been early turned from the
  pursuit of worldly pleasures and vanities by the inward appearing of the Lord Jesus,
  Mary Neale surrendered all to the cross of Christ and was made by Him a shining example
  of a true gospel minister. Of her life, James Gough (another highly esteemed minister in
  the Society of Friends) wrote, "I am ready to conclude that none in our day, from the
  time of the effectual visitation of Christ in her soul, adhered with more steadiness to
  His guidance, through a variety of probations."
