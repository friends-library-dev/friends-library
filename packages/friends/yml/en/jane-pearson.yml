    text:
      Dear Friends, nothing will do but keeping near to God, and dwelling always as in His
      presence! Do nothing in His sight that you would be afraid any mortal should see.
      Keep a pure heart and clean hands, and the end will be peace.

description:
  Jane Pearson (1735-1816) was a minister in the Society of Friends whose life, in many
  ways, resembled that of Job. About a year after her marriage, having begun in earnest to
  take up her cross and follow the Lord, she found that her “false rest was broken,” and
  for a period of fourteen years was made to wade through inward troubles and afflictions
  that were “far beyond her power of description.” And when there was at last an abatement
  of inward trials, then outward troubles poured in like a flood, and over the course of
  some years, she lost her husband and seven children to a variety of illnesses. But
  according to Christ’s promise, the more she gave up of this world and its treasures, the
  more she gained of eternal riches, and her experiences of God’s power and mercy in her
  latter years were truly a hundredfold more than all she had lost.
