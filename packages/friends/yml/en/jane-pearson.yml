    text:
      Dear Friends, nothing will do but keeping near to God, and dwelling always as in His
      presence! Do nothing in His sight that you would be afraid any mortal should see.
      Keep a pure heart and clean hands, and the end will be peace.

description:
  The story of Jane Pearson (1735–1816) is both heartbreaking and deeply inspiring. Her
  life was fraught with inward and outward trials beyond description. For fourteen years
  she wrestled with a variety of inward enemies as she sought to truly know and be
  conformed to the Beloved of her soul. And when at last she came to a measure of peace
  and stability in the Truth, she was then made to suffer the loss of her husband and
  seven children to a variety of illnesses. But the more she lost of the world, the more
  she seemed to gain of Christ, and her experiences of God’s power and mercy in her latter
  years are indescribably beautiful.
