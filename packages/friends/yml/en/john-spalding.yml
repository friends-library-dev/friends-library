  Though raised in the Church of England, John Spalding's (1765-1795) pursuit of truth
  left him dissatisfied with the traditional worship of his day, concluding that, in many
  respects, it was neither pleasing to God nor effective towards the salvation of his
  soul. After at last finding the Pearl of great price, he composed a public letter to
  beloved friends and family attending St. Giles church in Reading, entitling it - "A Few
  Reasons for Leaving the National Established Mode of Worship, addressed to the
  professors of religion in this day, by one who was long in the profession, but knew not
  the power, till it pleased the Lord, by the ministry and writings of the people called
  Quakers, to direct him to where alone the power is to be known, that is, within."
