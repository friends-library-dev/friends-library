    text:
      Rebecca Jones, a minister and mother in Israel (who had paid a religious visit to
      Friends in England and was highly esteemed by her contemporaries for religious
      experience, sound judgment and spiritual discernment) resided in this city, and her
      house was frequented by ministers and elders, and by younger members coming under
      the love of the Truth, who sought the benefit of her counsel and instructive
      conversation.

description:
  Words fail to describe the beautiful life and heart-tendering ministry of Rebecca Jones
  (1739-1818). When still a child, her eyes were opened to see the "ancient path" through
  the powerful preaching of Catherine Payton; and persevering in it all the days of her
  long and fruitful life, she was made a "vessel for honor, sanctified and useful to the
  Master, prepared for every good work." Her diary and letters are both endearing and
  instructive, telling the story of a meek disciple, a tireless minister, a loving "mother
  in Israel", a powerful preacher, and a shining example of every Christian virtue.

        description:
          During a lengthy ministry trip to Great Britain, Sarah Grubb spent many weeks
          traveling and ministering with Rebecca Jones, many details of which she relates
          in her journal. The two became cemented in a deep bond of friendship and kept up
          a correspondence that lasted until Sarah's death.
