    text:
      Oh my dear children, may you never rest but in the wrestling of the soul, until He
      has fully redeemed you, until He has finished the work He has begun in you. Oh! from
      my dying bed, I beg of you, that it may be the earnest breathing of your souls, that
      you may be redeemed from the perishing things of time, and that your affections may
      be fixed upon eternity. Oh, eternity! Oh, the length of eternity! Oh, that it may be
      impressed on every heart the length of eternity! There is no end!

description:
  Mary Hagger (1758-1840) was raised by pious parents, and being of a meek and humble
  disposition, was early visited by the power of the Lord, though at the time she says, "I
  knew not what it was that so sweetened and tendered my heart." Faithfully yielding to
  the convictions and instructions of grace, she was prepared by the Lord as a vessel for
  His service. But when she felt it required of her to bear public testimony to the
  goodness of the Lord, for many years the language of her heart was, "Send by whom you
  will send, but not by me." However, in the latter part of her life she was at last made
  willing to speak as the Lord enabled her, and became an instrument of usefulness in the
  church.
