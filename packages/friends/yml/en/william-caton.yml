description:
  William Caton (1636-1665) was just sixteen years old, and residing in the home of
  Margaret Fell in Swarthmore, when George Fox first came and preached the everlasting
  gospel in the demonstration of the Spirit and power. Caton was quickly convinced of the
  truth, and gave up to its purging and sanctifying power. He was made a effectual
  minister of the gospel before he was twenty years of age, but lived only to his
  twenty-ninth year. George Fox said of him - "His innocent life preached both
  righteousness and truth wherever he came, and was a sweet savor to God and in the hearts
  of the people. He was one who had a care for God's glory and honor, and for the
  spreading of the Truth and the prosperity of it. He had many trials and exercises by
  false brethren, backsliders, and apostates, and among priests and professors, but the
  Lord gave him dominion over all."
