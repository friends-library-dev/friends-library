description:
  Job Scott (1751-1793) was a gifted and well-beloved minister in the Society of Friends
  in America. He was known for his total dependence upon the immediate moving and
  empowering of the Holy Spirit, and his unwillingness to minister without a clear sense
  of the Lord’s will. On occasions, while preaching, he would suddenly stop speaking and
  sit down, explaining later that, having lost a sense of the authority and direction of
  the Spirit of God, he could do nothing without it. The writings in his journal abound
  with spiritual wisdom and experience, and have no doubt comforted and helped many weary
  travelers on the road to Zion. Job Scott died of Smallpox on a ministry trip to Ireland
  in 1793.
