      There was perhaps, with the exception of George Fox, no individual who had upon him
      a greater share of the weight and charge of the new Society [of Friends] than
      Stephen Crisp.

    text:
      For though it is true that none can obey the Lord but by His grace and power given
      unto them, yet He has made His grace—-even that grace which brings salvation—-appear
      unto all men, as is said in Titus 2:11. And this grace has appeared unto you, and in
      you, to whom I write, and is a reprover in you. You must therefore turn to that
      which smites you, and then you turn to the grace of God.

description:
  Stephen Crisp (1628-1692) is an example of one whose desperate search for Truth (lasting
  twenty long years) at last brought him to an experiential knowledge of the grace and
  truth that are in Jesus Christ. Having found the Pearl of great price, he sold all to
  buy it, and became an eminent preacher and writer among the early Society of Friends.
  For the remaining thirty-five years of his life, he labored in the power and wisdom of
  the Spirit, traveling throughout England, Scotland, Holland, and Germany, and writing
  many valuable epistles and treatises to the church in both the English and Dutch
  languages.

    description:
      The Plain Pathway is a short treatise written by Stephen Crisp concerning the
      appearance of Christ's light in the heart. In the words of the author, it was
      written "for the answering of all doubts and objections which arise against Christ's
      light and truth in the inward parts, by which many are kept from obedience, and so
      from peace to their panting souls."
    partial_description:
      A treatise describing the nature of Christ's appearance in the heart as a reprover
      for sin and transgression, and the necessity and benefit of submitting to His light
      and grace in order to be washed from within, and transformed into His likeness.

      true house of God. Beginning his journey with genuine hunger and zeal, he is soon

      enlightens his path, and leads him through deserts, bogs, and dangerous valleys to
      the true dwelling place of God.
