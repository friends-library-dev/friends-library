description:
  Stephen Crisp (1628-1692) is an example of one whose desperate search for Truth (lasting
  twenty long years) at last brought him to an experiential knowledge of the grace and
  truth that are in Jesus Christ. Having found the Pearl of great price, he sold all to
  buy it, and became an eminent preacher and writer among the early Society of Friends.
  For the remaining thirty-five years of his life, he labored in the power and wisdom of
  the Spirit, traveling throughout England, Scotland, Holland, and Germany, and writing
  many valuable epistles and treatises to the church in both the English and Dutch
  languages.

    description:
      The Plain Pathway is a short treatise written by Stephen Crisp concerning the
      appearance of Christ's light in the heart. According to Crisp, it was written "for
      the answering of all doubts and objections which arise against Christ's light and
      truth in the inward parts; by which many are kept from obedience, and so from peace
      to their panting souls."
