description:
  George Fox (1624-1691) is generally considered the founder of the Society of Friends
  (Quakers). As a young man, Fox could find no rest in the lifeless, outward Christianity
  of his day, seeing clearly that most believers professed far more than they tuly
  possessed. This journal tells the story of his desperate search for the Truth, his
  dicovery of a Christianity that stands in the life and light of Jesus Christ, and the
  ensuing fifty years of powerful ministry that turned the world upside down. This is the
  complete and unabridged Journal of Georged Fox, originally compiled and edited by Thomas
  Ellwood in 1694, and later divided into chapters, and supplied with numerous historical
  and biographical notes by William Armistead in 1852.
