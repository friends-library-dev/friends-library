quotes:
  - source: Thomas Ellwood
    text:
      He was valiant for the truth, bold in asserting it, patient in suffering for it,
      unwearied in labouring in it, steady in his testimony to it; immovable as a rock.
      Deep he was in divine knowledge, clear in opening heavenly mysteries, plain and
      powerful in preaching, fervent in prayer. He was richly endued with heavenly wisdom,
      quick in discerning, sound in judgment, able and ready in giving, discreet in
      keeping counsel; a lover of righteousness, an encourager of virtue, justice,
      temperance, meekness, purity, chastity, modesty, humility, charity, and self-denial
      in all, both by word and example.
  - source: William Penn
    text:
      But above all he excelled in prayer. The inwardness and weight of his spirit, the
      reverence and solemnity of his address and behavior, and the fewness and fulness of
      his words, have often struck even strangers with admiration, as they often reached
      others with consolation. The most awesome, living, reverent frame I ever felt or
      beheld, I must say, was his in prayer. And truly it was a testimony that he knew and
      lived nearer to the Lord than other men; for they that know Him most, see most
      reason to approach him with reverence and fear.

  George Fox (1624-1691) is generally considered the founder of the Society of Friends
  (Quakers). As a young man, Fox could find no rest in the lifeless, outward Christianity
  of his day, seeing clearly that most believers professed far more than they truly
  possessed. This journal tells the story of his desperate search for the Truth, his
  discovery of a Christianity that stands in the life and light of Jesus Christ, and the
  ensuing fifty years of powerful ministry that turned the world upside down. This is the
  complete and unabridged Journal of George Fox, originally compiled and edited by Thomas
  Ellwood in 1694, and later divided into chapters, and supplied with numerous historical
  and biographical notes by William Armistead in 1852.

          In her book The Lives and Persecutions of the Primitive Quakers, Mary Ann Kelty
          recounts the first dealings of the Lord with the young George Fox, and
          faithfully describes how God made use of this unschooled man to gather together
          a society of Christians that exemplified true "obedience of faith."

          In Primitive Christianity Revived, William Penn relates the rise, progress, and
          principle doctrines of the people called Quakers, and also declares (from "his
          own long and most inward acquaintance and intimate knowledge of him") the many
          excellent qualifications that God bestowed on George Fox.
