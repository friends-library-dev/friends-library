    text:
      Dearest Lord, remember my affliction, and enable me to say in deed and in truth,
      Your kingdom come, Your will be done in me, and by me, and through me, unworthy worm
      as I am. Oh let not Your hand spare, nor Your eye pity me, until You cause me to
      surrender my will in all things unto Your holy will!

description:
  Ann Branson (1808-1891) was one of the very last, true ministers (having been prepared,
  called, and used of the Lord) in a greatly reduced and sadly degenerate Society. Her
  deepest cry to the Lord, from the days of her childhood, was that “His eye would not
  pity, nor His hand spare” till He had thoroughly cleansed her heart, and made her a
  useful vessel in His house. Humbling herself before God and men, she was exalted by the
  Lord as a powerful and prophetic minister, one of the few in her day who stood in the
  purity and power of the original Quakers, even while all around her the 200 year old
  lampstand of the Society of Friends slowly and tragically burned out.

        description:
          In contending earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints, Ann Branson
          found a true friend and fellow-laborer in Joseph Edgerton, whose journal
          contains many letters addressed to her, and several references to the value of
          her ministry in that day.
