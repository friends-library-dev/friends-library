description:
  Samuel Rundell (1762 - 1848) was a wool-dealer who lived in Liskeard, a small town in
  southwest England. When young he befriended that worthy elder and "mother in Israel"
  Catherine Payton (Phillips), whose wisdom and piety no doubt made lasting impressions
  upon him. As a minister and author, Rundell was particularly concerned to press the
  necessity of a real and living experience of inward purification by an unreserved
  obedience to the light or Spirit of Christ working in the heart. Having witnessed its
  effectual operation in his own soul, he greatly desired to see this scriptural doctrine
  both upheld amongst his fellow Quakers and more widely known among sincere Christians of
  every denomination.
