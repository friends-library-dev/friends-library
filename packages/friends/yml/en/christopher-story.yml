description:
  Christopher Story (1648-1720) was inclined to piety from his youth. But when the Lord
  was pleased to open his understanding, he saw that his former religious building must be
  entirely thrown down, having not been built upon the true foundation. Being awakened to
  see something of the “exceeding sinfulness” of sin, he willingly bowed under the yoke of
  Christ, took up his daily cross, and thereby became a disciple and follower of Him. In
  time, he was endued with a large gift in the ministry which, though simple, was powerful
  and edifying, and was said to “often fall upon the people of God like a sweet shower
  upon the tender grass.”
