description:
  â€‹Thomas Ellwood (1639-1714) was a beloved elder and an eminent writer in the early
  Society of Friends. When a young man, his father took great offense at his joining in
  society with the despised people called Quakers, and frequently beat him with both fists
  and cane. At length, Ellwood found refuge in the home of Isaac and Mary Penington, where
  he came to be considered a member of their family, and eventually served as tutor to the
  Penington's young children. Thomas Ellwood is best known among Friends for his many
  publications in defense of the Truth, and for being the editor of George Fox's journal.
