    text:
      As [my father] passed the market-place, the tie of his shoe slackened; and while he
      stooped down to fasten it, a man came behind him and struck him on the back a hard
      blow with a stone, saying, "There, take that for Jesus Christâ€™s sake!" He answered,
      "So I do," not looking back to see who it was, but quietly going on his way.

description:
  John Roberts (1623-1684) was a man of piety, wisdom, and remarkable wit. He was
  convinced of the truth through the powerful ministry of Richard Farnsworth, while the
  latter was a prisoner at Banbury Jail, and through heartfelt submission to the truth
  became a respected minister in the Society of Friends, sometimes traveling with George
  Fox. The combination of John Roberts' blunt honesty, profound understanding, and
  humorous way of disputing with his adversaries, has long made the memoir of his life
  (written by his youngest son, Daniel) a favorite among early Quaker writings.
