    text:
      Often have I been led to make a pause, and crave of my heavenly Father, be pleased
      to make me like unto these your servants, whatever my sufferings in this life may
      be. If You will be with me in the way that I go, give me bread to eat and raiment to
      put on, You shall be my God, and I will serve You.

description:
  The heart of Sarah Stephenson (1738-1802) was turned to the Lord at a very young age.
  Though raised in a wealthy family where many of the world’s treasures were within reach,
  she says, “The Lord looked down upon me in love, and and so enamoured my soul with His
  beauty, that I loved to be alone with Him. O how sweet was His presence!” Submitting
  herself to the forming hand of grace, she grew deep in heavenly life and spiritual
  experience, and in addition to ministering in larger gatherings of the Lord’s people,
  she was used more particularly in visiting individual families, going from house to
  house and speaking to the conditions of people as the Lord gave her utterance.
