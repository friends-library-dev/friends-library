    text:
      Thus fell a valiant in the church militant, whose endowments and dedication are
      equalled by few of the present generation, and to whose memory, I believe, as
      general a tribute of tears has been paid, as to any person with whom I was ever
      acquainted.

description:
  ​​Sarah R. Grubb (1756-1790) was a woman of extraordinary natural abilities, strength of
  judgment, and clearness of discernment. Being favoured with a visitation of heavenly
  love when young, she submitted to Christ's refining fire and was brought into that
  passive condition wherein the vessels in the Lord's house are formed and fitted for
  usefulness. Having been early prepared for service, she came forth as a public minister
  about the twenty-third year of her age. Some years later, she and her husband founded a
  girls school in Clonmel, Ireland, where she lived and ministered until her death in
  1790, at only 34 years of age.
