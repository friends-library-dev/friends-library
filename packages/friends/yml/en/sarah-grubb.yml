description:
  ​​Sarah R. Grubb (1756-1790) was a woman of extraordinary natural abilities, strength of
  judgment, and clearness of discernment. Being favoured with a visitation of heavenly
  love when young, she submitted to Christ's refining fire and was brought into that
  passive condition wherein the vessels in the Lord's house are formed and fitted for
  usefulness. Having been early prepared for service, she came forth as a public minister
  about the twenty-third year of her age. Some years later, she and her husband founded a
  girls school in Clonmel, Irland, where she lived and ministered until death in 1790, at
  only 34 years of age.
