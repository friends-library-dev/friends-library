description:
  ​​Sarah R. Grubb (1756-1790) was a woman of extraordinary natural abilities, strength of
  judgment, and clearness of discernment. Being favoured with a visitation of heavenly
  love when young, she submitted to Christ's refining fire and was brought into that
  passive condition wherein the vessels in the Lord's house are formed and fitted for
  usefulness. Having been early prepared for service, she came forth as a public minister
  about the twenty-third year of her age. Some years later, she and her husband founded a
  girls school in Clonmel, Ireland, where she lived and ministered until her death in
  1790, at only 34 years of age.

        description:
          During a lengthy ministry trip to Great Britain, Rebecca Jones spent many weeks
          traveling and ministering with Sarah Grubb, many details of which she relates in
          her journal. The two became cemented in a deep bond of friendship and kept up a
          correspondence that lasted until Sarah's death.

          This is just to show you that there can be (and often will be) multiple related
          documents. This should be deleted and replaced with something real, the id above
          is Mary Neale, which I don't think should be attached to Sarah Grubb. Lorem
