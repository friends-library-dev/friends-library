description:
  Mary Dudley (1750-1823) was a seeker of truth and righteousness from her earliest days.
  When around 20 years old, she joined the Methodists for two or three years, and was much
  esteemed by John Wesley for her humble devotion and pious example. Before long, however,
  she began to feel that their active and outward zeal was not compatible with the
  spiritual poverty she felt in herself, and the great need she had seen for total
  dependence upon the Spirit of God for all true worship and ministry. Finding a home
  among the Quakers, she grew to become a powerful minister and a "mother in Israel,"
  traveling often, and pointing many hearts to the covenant of light and life in Jesus
  Christ.
