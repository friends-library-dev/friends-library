    text:
      His name was called Jesus, because He should save His people from their sins, not in
      them; so that, notwithstanding all that Christ Jesus has done and suffered for us,
      and that His love is offered to us universally, we really know Him not as a Savior
      and Redeemer, but in proportion as we are saved by Him from that evil seed which
      leads into transgression.

description:
  Mary Dudley (1750-1823) was a seeker of truth and righteousness from her earliest days.
  When around 20 years old, she joined the Methodists for two or three years, and was much
  esteemed by John Wesley for her humble devotion and pious example. Before long, however,
  she began to feel that their active and outward zeal was not compatible with the
  spiritual poverty she felt in herself, and the great need she had seen for total
  dependence upon the Spirit of God for all true worship and ministry. Finding a home
  among the Quakers, she grew to become a powerful minister and a “mother in Israel,”
  traveling often, and pointing many hearts to the covenant of light and life in Jesus
  Christ.

          Though not mentioned in her journal, Thomas Scattergood was an intimate friend
          and frequent companion of Mary Dudley during his six years of ministerial labor
          in Europe. Scattergood’s journal contains several letters from Mary, and
          frequently mentions being encouraged by her words and assisted by her sympathy
          in his uncommon trials.
