  Richard Davies (1635–1708) was another who desperately sought after Truth from his
  earliest days, and became the first Welshmen to be convinced of the principles preached
  by the Early Quakers. Through many hardships (beatings, mockings, long imprisonments,
  etc.) he grew up in the Lord and became a eminent minister in the Society of Friends,
  being so filled with the Lord's humility and love that even his enemies respected and
  admired him.
