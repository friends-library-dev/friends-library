    text:
      '[Richard Davies] was not only a professor of the name, power, and spirit of our
      blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, but also made a partaker of Christ, in
      spirit, life, and conduct; a plain, meek, and humble man of integrity; a man fearing
      God and hating iniquity; a man sanctified by the Holy Spirit, unto unfeigned and
      constant love of his brethren in Christ.'

description:
  Richard Davies (1635–1708) was a man who desperately sought after Truth from his
  earliest days, and became the first Welshmen to be convinced of the principles preached
  by the Early Quakers. Through many hardships (beatings, mockings, long imprisonments,
  etc.) he grew up in the Lord and became a eminent minister in the Society of Friends,
  being so filled with the Lord's humility and love that even his enemies respected and
  admired him.
