    text:
      Though [Thomas Wilson] had a large gift [in the ministry], beyond many, yet he was
      glad to hear the least child who spoke from the motion of God’s Spirit, having
      learned to cast down his crown at the feet of the Lamb, for whose exaltation he was
      given up to spend and be spent.

      In a particular manner, I became nearly united in the divine love and life of truth
      with my much esteemed friend Thomas Wilson, then of Cumberland, and afterwards of
      Ireland; who was to me the most able and powerful minister of the Word of Life in
      the age.

description:
  Thomas Wilson (1654-1725) was an esteemed minister in the early Society of Friends,
  whose dedicated life manifested the “sweet savor of the knowledge of Christ in every
  place.” As a child, he gave up to follow the Lord out of the vanities of the world, and
  abiding faithfully under the cross, experienced its power “bringing forth judgment unto
  victory.” He became a powerful minister of the gospel (often the traveling companion of
  James Dickinson), whose preaching both pierced the hearts of the humble and confounded
  the minds of adversaries. His godly example in life, great humility, and self-denial
  greatly adorned his ministry, and he was made a watchful shepherd over the flock of
  Christ in England, Ireland, Scotland, and America.
