description:
  Thomas Shillitoe (1754-1836) was a man who knew the voice of the Good Shepherd, and
  followed it unreservedly through even the most trying and perplexing circumstances. For
  many years, he traveled as a minister (often on foot) all over Great Britain, Europe,
  Russia, and America, carefully minding all that his Master required of him, whether it
  involved attending to the most basic needs of the poor and distressed, or meeting with
  kings, princes, and heads of state. In 1826, he left England for the United States,
  where he spent several years laboring to uphold the original principles and practices of
  Friends against the erroneous doctrines and disorderly conduct of Elias Hicks and his
  adherents.
