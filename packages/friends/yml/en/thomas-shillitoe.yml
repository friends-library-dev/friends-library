      There is a nice book in the bookcase that I know would interest you, “The Life of
      Thomas Shillitoe,” who was a poor shoemaker, but a faithful minister of the Gospel,
      who out of much weakness (naturally) was made strong in his Lord, to go through many
      dangers and labours, and out of a very timid, fearful disposition was made bold as a
      lion, to stand before kings and princes and the fiercest looking of men.

      What a journal is Thomas Shillitoe’s! I never found in any one more of attention to
      Divine guidance in all things, and always; nor more plentiful, blessed results and
      precious fruit, from being wholly given up to the Lord in body, soul, and spirit;
      through all perplexity, trouble, and sore exercise of faith and patience. How
      unspeakably glorious must be the crown he now inherits forever and ever, after
      bearing his cross so faithfully to the end of time!

description:
  Thomas Shillitoe (1754-1836) was a man who knew the voice of the Good Shepherd, and
  followed it unreservedly through even the most trying and perplexing circumstances. For
  many years, he traveled as a minister (often on foot) all over Great Britain, Europe,
  Russia, and America, carefully minding all that his Master required of him, whether it
  involved attending to the most basic needs of the poor and distressed, or meeting with
  kings, princes, and heads of state. In 1826, he left England for the United States,
  where he spent several years laboring to uphold the original principles and practices of
  Friends against the erroneous doctrines and disorderly conduct of Elias Hicks and his
  adherents.

          In 1824, Thomas Shillitoe went to St. Petersburg, Russia, and frequently
          attended the small meeting held in the home of his beloved friend Daniel
          Wheeler. After spending several months in the city, he and Daniel Wheeler
          traveled together by land some 1600 miles to Rotterdam, Holland.
