description:
  â€‹Martha Routh (1743-1817) was working as the principal of a Friend's boarding school in
  Nottingham, England when, at age of 30, she was called by the Lord to travel in the work
  of the ministry. The remaining 44 years of her life were devoted to preaching the gospel
  throughout all parts of England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, and America. Her first trip
  to America was in 1794, where she labored for over three years, traveling over 11,000
  miles, before returning to her native country. She returned to America in 1801 with her
  husband (who died shortly after his arrival in New York). Martha Routh's life and
  ministry were exemplary in every respect, and her preaching was "in demonstration of the
  Spirit and of power."

          During a great part of her first trip to the United States, Martha Routh was
          often a companion in the work of the ministry to John Wigham, whom she
          frequently mentions with great esteem in her journal, calling him her "valued
          friend and brother in gospel fellowship."

          Though a native of England, Martha Routh spent many years in America in the
          service of the gospel, where she met and befriended that humble but
          highly-esteemed minister of Christ, Rebecca Jones. Rebecca's journal makes many
          reference to Martha Routh, and includes several letters written to her on
          various occasions.
