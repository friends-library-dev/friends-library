    text:
      +++[+++James Gough] was a living minister, and well instructed in the mysteries of
      the kingdom; he was adorned with the beautiful robes of love, and he eminently felt
      peace on earth to abound in him, and goodwill towards men. He was a devoted faithful
      labourer in the heavenly vineyard, and he delighted to see the youth under a
      heavenly visitation, fitting and preparing for the Lord's vineyard.

description:
  ​As a boy, James Gough (1712-1780) was known for his genius intellect, having mastered
  the Greek and Latin tongues when still a young child. At one point, after conversing
  with young James, a distinguished Justice of the Peace so admired his propensity for
  learning that he offered to pay his way through university. But although such flattery
  sowed seeds of pride and vanity in James’ young heart, it pleased the Lord to visit him
  in power and love, and he was prevailed upon to give up all that he had once called gain
  to follow Christ. James Gough became a wise and well-beloved minister among the Society
  of Friends, but having learned to live low at the feet of His Master, he was always
  remarkable for his deep humility, and low opinion of himself.
