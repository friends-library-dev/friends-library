    text:
      "[James Gough] was a living minister, and well instructed in the mysteries of the
      kingdom; he was adorned with the beautiful robes of love, and he eminently felt
      peace on earth to abound in him, and goodwill towards men. He was a devoted faithful
      labourer in the heavenly vineyard, and he delighted to see the youth under a
      heavenly visitation, fitting and preparing for the Lord's vineyard."

description:
  ​As a boy, James Gough (1712-1780) was known for his genius intellect, having mastered
  the Greek and Latin tongues when still a young child. At one point, after conversing
  with young James, a distinguished Justice of the Peace so admired his propensity for
  learning that he offered to pay his way through university. But although such flattery
  sowed seeds of pride and vanity in James’ young heart, it pleased the Lord to visit him
  in power and love, and he was prevailed upon to give up all that he had once called gain
  to follow Christ. James Gough became a wise and well-beloved minister among the Society
  of Friends, but having learned to live low at the feet of His Master, he was always
  remarkable for his deep humility, and low opinion of himself.

      Like his older brother James, John Gough (1721-1791) was gifted with a keen
      intellect and so excelled in his studies that he became an assistant to a Friends
      school in Wiltshire when only sixteen years of age. As an adult he became master of
      boarding schools in Cork, Dublin, and Lisburn, but was also very active in the work
      of the ministry, both preaching and writing for the advancement of the gospel. In
      1782, when sixty-one years of age, he commenced his four-volume History of the
      Society of Friends, which occupied him for eight years, and was published in 1790.
      This immense work gave a full, clear, and accurate portrayal of the history of
      Friends, adding valuable information to what had already been recorded in Sewel’s
      “History,” and continuing the history of this people until 1764.
