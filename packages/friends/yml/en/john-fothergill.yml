gender: male
description: John Fothergill (1676-1745) was a true minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ, made so by the Spirit of God, and not by the wisdom or will of man. As a young man, he took the yoke of his Master upon himself, learned to bear it faithfully, and so experientially knew what it was to be "be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the Spirit" (1 Pet. 4:6). Constrained by the love of Christ, his life was poured out in the service of the gospel, traveling all over England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, on several occasions, and crossing the seas three times to visit the colonies in America. John Fothergill was the father of Samuel Fothergill (the well-known Quaker minister) and Dr. John Fothergill, the famous doctor and botanist.
