description:
  John Fothergill (1676-1745) was a true minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ, made so
  by the Spirit of God, and not by the will or wisdom of man. As a young man, he took the
  yoke of his Master upon himself, learned to bear it faithfully, and so experientially
  knew what it was to be "be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to
  God in the Spirit" (1 Pet. 4:6). Constrained by the love of Christ, his life was poured
  out in the service of the gospel, traveling all over England, Scotland, Wales, and
  Ireland on several occasions, and crossing the seas three times to visit the colonies in
  America. John Fothergill was the father of Samuel Fothergill (the well-known Quaker
  minister) and Dr. John Fothergill, the famous doctor and botanist.
