  - source: John Fothergill
    text:
      My heart groans within me, that it may continually be your, and all our care, to
      labor with due watchfulness, to walk humbly before Him, to feel after His living
      power, and to bear His yoke resignedly and cheerfully; that thereby we may be
      crucified to the world, with the evils and hurtful friendships of it.
  - source: Samuel Fothergill
    text:
      I have found it my duty and great advantage to place in view my worthy father, and
      in matters of importance, or dubious cases, to consult what would have pleased him,
      who was ripe in experience and judgment.

description:
  John Fothergill (1676-1745) was a true minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ, made so
  by the Spirit of God, and not by the will or wisdom of man. As a young man, he took the
  yoke of his Master upon himself, learned to bear it faithfully, and so experientially
  knew what it was to be "be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to
  God in the Spirit" (1 Pet. 4:6). Constrained by the love of Christ, his life was poured
  out in the service of the gospel, traveling all over England, Scotland, Wales, and
  Ireland on several occasions, and crossing the seas three times to visit the colonies in
  America. John Fothergill was the father of Samuel Fothergill (the well-known Quaker
  minister) and Dr. John Fothergill, the famous doctor and botanist.

        description:
          Although Samuel Fothergill (son of John Fothergill) turned from the Lord at a
          young age and began to "drink up iniquity as an ox drinks water," he was at
          length pierced to the heart with a sight of his rebellion, and so
          whole-heartedly turned back to the Lord that he became an eminent minister in
          his day, walking in the footsteps of his worthy father.
