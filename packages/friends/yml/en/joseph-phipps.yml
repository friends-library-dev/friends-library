    text:
      Perfect redemption then consists, first, in paying the price of ransom; and second,
      in bringing out of bondage, and setting the prisoner at liberty. Our Savior paid the
      first by His suffering and sacrifice, and He performs the last by the effectual
      operation of His Spirit in the hearts of those who receive Him and resign wholly to
      Him.

description:
  Though a shoe maker by trade, Joseph Phipps (1708–1787) was the author of several
  scholarly publications explaining and defending the tenets of Early Friends. In 1772, in
  response to a critical publication by a man named Samuel Newton, Phipps wrote “The
  Original and Present State of Man,” in which he cleared the Society from many unjust and
  untrue charges, and also defended and clarified the leading principles and practices of
  the Quakers. This extraordinary little book deals with “The nature of man’s fall, and
  the necessity, means, and manner of his restoration through the sacrifice of Christ, and
  the discernible operation of that Divine Spirit of grace and truth.”

          Those who appreciate the solid and biblical arguments of Joseph Phipps in the
          “The Original and Preset State of Man,” will most certainly enjoy Robert
          Barclay’s famous “Apology for the True Christian Divinity,” which is doubtless
          the most well-known of all Friends’ theological writings.
