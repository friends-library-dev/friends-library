description:
  Though a shoe maker by trade, Joseph Phipps (1708–1787) was the author of several
  scholarly publications explaining and defending the tenets of Early Friends. In 1772, in
  response to a critical publication by a man named Samuel Newton, Phipps wrote "The
  Original and Present State of Man," in which he cleared the Society from many unjust and
  untrue charges, and also defended and clarified the leading principles and practices of
  the Quakers. This extraordinary little book deals with "The nature of man's fall, and
  the necessity, means, and manner of his restoration through the sacrifice of Christ, and
  the discernible operation of that Divine Spirit of grace and truth."
