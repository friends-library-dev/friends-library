    text:
      Ever since men came to be persuaded that though they sow tares, they shall still
      reap wheat, and though they go down to the grave sinners, they shall still rise
      saints, and attain in another world what the primitive Christians attained in this
      world; since then, I say, the citizenship of Christians has not been in heaven, but
      in the earth. They have walked in darkness and not in the light.
description:
  Apart from the fact that he worked as a schoolmaster in Bristol, and died in the year
  1713, virtually nothing is known about the life of Hugh Turford. However, his little
  book “Walk in the Spirit,” first published in 1702 (but having been reprinted in
  twenty-eight English editions, and translated into French, Spanish, Italian, German, and
  Danish) is considered by many to be among the most influential of all early Quaker
  writings.

    description:
      The primitive Christians built on a sure rock, a living foundation, on Christ as He
      was in all ages, and still is—on His spiritual appearance as the light of the world,
      and the life of righteousness. His work of sanctification is inward, and is to be
      effected by inward means. Nothing but inward light can expel inward darkness;
      nothing less than eternal life can deliver our souls from the power of death. But
      this way of God’s salvation has been so long rejected, that few in our present age
      know what His Spirit is, where they may become acquainted with it, or how they may
      walk in it.
    partial_description:
      A treatise by Hugh Turford first demonstrating the meaning and importance of Paul’s
      words to the Galatians, “Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of
      the flesh,” and then explaining the nature of grace, and how it saves from sin and
      affects man’s salvation.
