name: John Griffeth
slug: john-griffeth
description: John Griffith (1713-1776) was a powerful minister during a time when the light, life, and power of Christ was slowly declining among the Society of Friends. Together with a remnant of bright, shining lamps in his generation, Griffith warred against a sad degeneracy into formality, tradition, and lifeless words amongst a people once distinguished by their adherence to the inward power and purity of the Holy Spirit.
