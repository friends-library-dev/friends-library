description: Though a shoe maker by trade, Joseph Phipps (1708–1787) was the author of several scholarly publications explaining and defending the tenets of Early Friends. In 1772, in response to a critical publication by one Samuel Newton, Phipps wrote The Original and Present State of Man, in which he cleared the Society from many unjust and untrue charges, and also clarified the leading principles and practices of the Quakers. This book deals with "The nature of man's fall, and the necessity, means, and manner of his restoration through the sacrifice of Christ, and the sensible operation of that Divine Spirit of grace and truth."
