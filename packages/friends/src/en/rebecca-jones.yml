description: Words fail to describe the beautiful life and heart-tendering ministry of Rebecca Jones (1739-1818). When still a child, her eyes were opened to see the "ancient path" through the powerful preaching of Catherine Payton; and persevering in it all the days of her long and fruitful life, she was made a "vessel for honor, sanctified and useful to the Master, prepared for every good work." Her diary and letters are both endearing and instructive, telling the story of a meek disciple, a powerful preacher, a tireless minister, a loving "mother in Israel", and an shining example of innocence, love, humility, and faithfulness to the Lord Jesus Christ.
