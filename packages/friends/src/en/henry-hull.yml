description: â€‹Henry Hull (1765-1834) loved the Lord from a young age, and was desirous to serve Him, but being diffident and shy by nature, was unwilling to give up to a call to the ministry until a voice sounded in the ear of his understanding, saying, "You are in great danger of being lost in your rebellion." At that moment, Henry put his hand to the plow and never looked back, saying, "Lord, do what You will with me, come life or death, I will give up all for Your sake." He travelled much in the ministry in different parts of the United States and Canada, and also crossed the Atlantic to visit the churches of God in Ireland and England. While in England, he met with the severe trial of receiving a letter informing him of the death of his wife, son, and mother, all by a malignant fever that had spread through his native land. Though deeply grieved by this heavy affliction, he was nevertheless enabled to say, "Though He slay me, yet I will trust in Him. It is the Lord, let Him do what seems good to Him."
