    description: This document is a short treatise written by Stephen Crisp concerning the appearance of Christ's light in the heart. In Crisp's words, this was written "for the answering of all doubts and objections which arise against Christ's light and truth in the inward parts; by which many are kept from obedience, and so from peace to their panting souls."
