gender: male
description: Thomas Wilson (1654-1725) was another remarkable minister in the early Society of Friends, whose dedicated life manifested the "sweet savor of the knowledge of Christ in every place." As a child, he gave up to follow the Lord out of the vanities of the world, and abiding faithfully under the cross, experienced its power "bringing forth judgment unto victory." He became a powerful minister of the gospel (often the traveling companion of James Dickenson, whose journal is also available on this site), with preaching that both pierced the hearts of the humble and confounded the minds of adversaries. His godly example in life, great humility, and self-denial greatly adorned his ministry, and he was made a tender shepherd over the flock of Christ in England, Ireland, Scotland, and America.
