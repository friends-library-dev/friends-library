name: Francis Howgill
slug: francis-howgill
description: Francis Howgill (1618-1669), received a university education to become a minister in the Episcopal church. However, being dissatisfied with the superstition which he saw remaining in it, he soon left it, joining himself to the Independents, and then to the Anabaptists, desperately seeking the true spiritual life that his soul thirsted after. At length, being mightily affected by the ministry of George Fox, he joined the persecuted society called Quakers, among whom he became a widely respected member and evangelist. He died in prison for his testimony to the truth, leaving behind many influential books and letters.
