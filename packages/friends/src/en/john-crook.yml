description: Like many other early Quakers, John Crook (1617-1699) was a seeker of truth from his earliest days. He was educated in London, and for a time held the office of Justice of the Peace in Bedfordshire, but when he was convinced of the truth in 1654 by the preaching of William Dewsbury, he soon lost both his public office and his freedom. In all, John Crook was imprisoned ten times for his faith, and suffered greatly at "the hands of unreasonable men."
