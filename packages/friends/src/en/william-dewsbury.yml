name: William Dewsbury
slug: william-dewsbury
description: William Dewsbury (1621-1688) was an eminent minister and elder in the early Society of Friends whose role in the formation and oversight of the Society was comparable to that of George Fox. Like Paul the apostle, the gospel that Dewsbury preached was not according to man, neither did he receive it from man, but rather through the revelation of Jesus Christ; nor was his preaching with persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power. His care for the church, and influence in the lives and hearts of thousands, continued even while imprisoned for nineteen years. After visiting William Dewsbury in 1676, John Whiting described him as "an extraordinary man in many ways, and I thought, as exact a pattern of a perfect man as I ever knew."
