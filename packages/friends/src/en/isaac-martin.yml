description: ​Isaac Martin (1758-1828) was a sweet-spirited minister in the Society of Friends. Having fallen from a two-story window ​and cracked his skull when a small child, he suffered agonizing pain in his head and eye for the great majority of his life. But despite his frequent ailments, he submitted whole-heartedly to Christ's baptism of Spirit and fire, and became a effective minister who depended entirely upon the power and direction of the Holy Spirit. On this subject he once wrote - "Unless I had felt ​the Lord's​ blessed presence to strengthen and qualify me, I would rather have laid down my life, than have attempted to minister to the people by virtue of any ​knowledge or abilit​y​, natural or acquired, which, as a man, I might possess.​"​
