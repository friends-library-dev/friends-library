description: David Ferris (1707-1779) was favored as a young child with a merciful visitation of the Lord whereby he was called out of the vanities of the world and enabled to see through the empty forms and superstitions of man-made religion. He was brought up a Presbyterian and educated in their way, but by attending to the inward teachings of divine grace, he became convinced of the principles of Friends (having no outward knowledge of their doctrines or practices), being clearly shown that the Lord was to be worshipped in spirit and truth by those who had been "judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the Spirit." (1 Pet. 4:6). Being timid and diffident by nature, he resisted the Lord's call to ministry for many years, but at last gave up to preach the gospel as the Lord gave him utterance.
