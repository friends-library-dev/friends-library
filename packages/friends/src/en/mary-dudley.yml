gender: female
description: Mary Dudley (1750-1823) was a seeker of truth and righteousness from her earliest days. When around 20 years old, she joined the Methodists for two or three years, and was much esteemed by John Wesley for her humble devotion and pious example. She soon found, however, that their active and outward zeal was not compatible with the spiritual poverty she felt in herself, and the great need she had seen for total dependence upon the Spirit of God for all true worship and ministry. Finding a home among the Quakers, she grew to become a powerful minister and a "mother in Israel", pointing many to the covenant of light and life in Jesus Christ.
