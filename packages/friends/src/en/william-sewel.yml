description: William Sewel (1653-1720), being a Quaker himself, and an eye-witness to many of the events described in this history, is considered by all to be the foremost authority on the early history of the Society of Friends. This lengthy (but truly remarkable) work was first published in Dutch in 1717, and then translated by Sewel into English and printed in 1722. The original publication consisted of twelve volumes, but was reprinted (with slightly modernized spelling and punctuation) in 1832 in two large volumes. There are two versions of this publication on this website. One is an unabridged and unchanged 1832 edition, with all the archaic spellings and vocabulary. The other is also unabridged, but archaic spellings and vocabulary have been somewhat modernized to aid the modern reader.
