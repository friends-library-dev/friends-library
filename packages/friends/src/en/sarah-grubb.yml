description: ​​Sarah R. Grubb (1756-1790) was a woman of extraordinary natural abilities, strength of judgment, and clearness of discernment. Being favoured with a visitation of heavenly love in the morning of her day, she submitted to Christ's refining fire and was brought into that passive nothingness wherein the vessels in the Lord's house are formed and fitted for usefulness. Having been early prepared for service, she came forth in public ministry about the twenty-third year of her age, and continued a faithful and powerful minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ until her death in 1790, at only 34 years of age.
