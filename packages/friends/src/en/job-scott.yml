name: Job Scott
slug: job-scott
description: Job Scott (1751-1793) was a gifted and well-beloved minister in the Society of Friends in America. He was known for his total dependence upon the immediate moving and empowering of the Holy Spirit, and his unwillingness to minister without a clear sense of the Lord's will. On occasions, while preaching, he would suddenly stop speaking and sit down, explaining later that, having lost a sense of the authority and direction of the Spirit of God, he could do nothing without it. The writings in his journal are weighty and living, and have no doubt comforted and helped many weary travelers on the road to Zion. Job Scott died of Smallpox on a ministry trip to Ireland in 1793.
