    title: Waiting Upon the Lord
    slug: waiting-upon-the-lord
    description: The greatest part of this booklet is an updated version of the eleventh proposition of Robert Barclay's Apology for the True Christian Divinity.1 The entire volume of Barclay's Apology (consisting of fifteen propositions in all) is a tremendous and compelling work that I strongly recommend to every serious seeker of the Truth. I have chosen to modernize and republish just this one proposi- tion because it seems to me that the invaluable practice of waiting upon the Lord has been especially neglected, and has all but disappeared from the church today.
