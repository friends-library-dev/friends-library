    title: Waiting Upon the Lord

    description: Robert Barclay writes, “All true and acceptable worship to God is offered in the inward and immediate moving and drawing of His own Spirit.” It is not hard to agree with such a statement, but who has indeed stood still to see the salvation of the Lord, and known the dawning of His inward Day? Have we waited upon our God to separate the precious from the vile within, to differentiate between the pure operation of His Spirit and the wild rovings of our own soul? Have we truly known and obeyed His inward stirrings and teachings, or does the Seed of God lay buried in Christian hearts beneath a mass of superstition, assumption, and fleshy, religious activity?

    description: Robert Barclay's "Apology for the True Christian Divinity" is perhaps the most well-known of all Friends' writings. "Saved to the Uttermost" (which is taken from propositions four through eight of the Apology) brilliantly expounds some of the most vital and misunderstood aspects of Christianity, plainly manifesting the true nature, experience, and extent of the salvation that God offers the soul through Jesus Christ.
