description: â€‹At the age of twenty-two, Samuel Neale (1729-1792) was powerfully impacted by the ministry of Catharine Payton and Mary Peisley (his future wife) while they were ministering in the city of Dublin, Ireland. Having seen and felt that he was traveling on the broad path that leads to destruction, Samuel Neale set his heart to "wait upon the Lord in the way of His judgments." And becoming acquainted with the true baptism of Christ (that of Spirit and fire), he was called into the ministry, and spent much of his life traveling and ministering to the Lord's body.
