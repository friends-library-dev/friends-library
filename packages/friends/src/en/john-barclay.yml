name: John Barclay
slug: john-barclay
gender: male
description: John Barclay (1797-1838), though a descendent of the well-known Barclay family, was a complete stranger to the life and power of Truth until he began to seek the Lord with all his heart, somewhere around his 18th year. The Society of Friends at that time was in a sad and declining state, but John Barclay dug deep and found the Root of life from which early Quakers had sprouted, and became a living branch himself, and a very useful minister. He lived only 41 years, but his short life was wholly dedicated to his Master's cause, and many of the journals, memoirs, and biographies of Early Friends are the fruit of his arduous and faithful labor with the original documents.
