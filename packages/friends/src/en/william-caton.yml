description: William Caton (1636-1665) was just sixteen years old, and residing in the home of Thomas and Margaret Fell in Swarthmore, when George Fox first came and preached the everlasting gospel in the demonstration of the Spirit and power. Caton was quickly convinced of the truth, and gave up to its purging and sanctifying power, by which He was made a effectual minister of the gospel before he was twenty years of age. Though he lived to be only twenty-nine, George Fox said - ​"​His innocent life preached both righteousness and truth wherever​ he came​,​ and was a good savor to God, and in the hearts of the people. He was one who had a care of God's glory and honor, and the spreading of the Truth and the prosperity of it​. In his travels he had many trials and exercises by false brethren, backsliders, and apostates, besides his perils by sea, and among the priests and professors​. But the Lord with ​H​is eternal arm and power gave him dominion over all."
