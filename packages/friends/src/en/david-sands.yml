description: David Sands (1745-1816) was an active and influential minister in the Society of Friends at a time when the minds of many Friends had been corrupted from the original simplicity and purity of the gospel. Originally from Long Island, Sands labored extensively throughout New England, and also made a trip to Europe where he preached the gospel in England, Ireland, France, Germany, and several other parts of the continent. His life was fraught with many deep conflicts, difficulties, and opposition, but he remained a faithful and solid elder in the midst of a much deteriorated Society.
