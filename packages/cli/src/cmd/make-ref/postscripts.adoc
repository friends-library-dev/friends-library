Dear Cousin,

G+++.+++ M.--In fresh and near love my dear salutation often and now reaches to you and mother,
with all my near and dear friends about you;
though under pain of heart that I am unexpectedly so long detained from you;
but the free assurance is renewedly extended,
that the heavenly Hand and holy living power engages me here for the good of souls,
and helping to build up the house for the praise of the King of righteousness.

I and three other Friends were seven days and nights,
and had meetings among other people, without coming to any Friend`'s house,
and travelled hard, having in that time rode near 300 miles in almost constant rain,
which hurt my health; however the glorious name of the Lord was with us,
and was magnified.

Friends,

All children of new Jerusalem, that descends from above, the holy city,
which the Lord and the Lamb is the light thereof, and is the temple:
in it they are born again of the spirit:
so Jerusalem that is above is the mother of them that are born of the spirit.
And so they that come, and are come, to heavenly Jerusalem, are them that receive Christ;
and he giveth them power to become the sons of God, and are born again of the spirit:
so Jerusalem that is above, is their mother.
And such do come to heavenly mount Zion, and the innumerable company of angels,
and to the spirits of just men made perfect;
and are come to the church of the living God, written in heaven,
and have the name of God, and the city of God written upon them: so here is a new mother,
that brings forth a heavenly and a spiritual generation.

There is no schism, nor division, nor contention, nor strife, in heavenly Jerusalem,
nor in the body of Christ, which is made up of living stones, a spiritual house.
And Christ is not divided, for in him there is peace.
Christ saith, in me you have peace.
And he is from above, and not of this world; but in the world below, in the spirit of it,
there is trouble: therefore keep in Christ, and walk in him, Amen.

but all they that are come out of the apostacy by the power and spirit of Christ,
Jerusalem that is above, is their mother, and none below her;
who doth nourish all her spiritual children.

This year I find that William Goodridge, of Banwell, in Somersetshire,
was released from prison, where he had been confined about thirteen years.
He had been premunired for refusing to take the oath: and his goods,

and the real estate counted worth sixty pounds per annum, were confiscated.

An Epistle to Friends of Charlecot, in Wilts.

[.salutation]
Dear Friends,

All keep on the watch-tower,
wherein alone you are in a capacity to hear what the Lord says,
and in which you will find peace spoken unto you, that none may go back into folly,
into earthliness, carelessness, or double-mindedness again.
And tender Friends, keep your meetings diligently,
and therein wait with an earnest expectation of Christ Jesus
coming in among you and breathing on you invisibly;
through which breath of life, your senses can alone be made living;
and so being daily watered and refreshed,
you will go away inwardly strengthened and increased.
So dear friends, be faithful in watering and diligent in watching,
and then you will find and feel the breakings in of the pure,
heavenly power of the everlasting, true God upon your spirits,
through which your meetings will be kept living and fresh;
so will the great travail that has been for you be answered.
And this I say unto you in the name of the Lord, if after such dressing, pruning,
and watering that has been among you, you keep not in the Son of the endless,
boundless love of God, but allow your minds to go into the earth,
the Lord shall bow you down dreadfully, and render unto you the reward of forgetfulness,
carelessness and earthly-mindedness; out of which, dear friends, in the love of God,
I earnestly desire you all may keep, a sweet savour unto the Lord;
that so the servants of God coming among you, may be refreshed,
your souls therein abundantly comforted, and the worthy name of the Lord God magnified:
this is the breathing of your travailing friend and brother,

To Leopold the Second, King of Hungary, Bohemia, etc.

Among the numerous congratulations awaiting your accession to the imperial crown,
accept, O king, our Christian good wishes,
and solicitude for your present and eternal wellbeing.

We are conscious that we have no claim to the liberty of addressing you,
but from a belief that the Lord Almighty, who rules in the kingdoms of men,
and gives them to whomsoever he will,
has inclined us to leave our habitations to visit some parts of this country,
and now engages us, in gospel love, to express our secret and united prayer,
that you may be an instrument in his holy hand for the advancement of that glorious day,
spoken of by the prophet, "`when swords shall be beaten into plowshares;
and spears into pruning-hooks; when nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
neither shall they learn war any more.`"

Through the neglect of a principle so pure and important,
how has the rational part of God`'s creation been
sacrificed to the irregular passions of sovereigns,
and many unprepared souls precipitated into an awful futurity!
That the gospel dispensation is intended to remedy these evils,
and promote the government of the Prince of Peace;
that the Gentiles are to come to its light, and kings to the brightness of its arising,
are truths to which the sacred records abundantly testify.

Dear Friends,

Your joint communication, replete with the expression of brotherly kindness and regard,
was put into my hand just as we were quitting the shores of Oahu.
Although utterly unmerited on my part, yet I feel compelled to accept it,
from a belief in the purity of those motives by which it was dictated; while,
at the same time, the feeling is awakened,
that to me belongs only "`blushing and confusion of face.`"
I rejoice in the opportunity so soon afforded me to acknowledge its receipt,
and more especially because I had felt my mind drawn towards you,
before I saw its contents;
desiring more and more that you may individually become
acquainted with the binding influence of that love,
which many waters cannot quench,

Although I had been called out of the world, and uncommonly favoured, as before related;
although I had forsaken the vanities and flesh-pleasing
gratifications in which I had delighted;
although I had left the college in a way so mortifying, had given up all to death,
and freely borne the cross of being esteemed a fool by the world;
afterwards joining with the despised Quakers, adopting their language,
dress and behaviour; (all which I could not have done without Divine assistance;) yet,
after all this, I was so forgetful, and ungrateful to my heavenly Benefactor,
that it is a wonder I was ever restored.
And I have no doubt that thousands, through negligence,
even after they have been called out of the world, and have run well for a season,
have been finally lost;
swimming away in the riches and pleasures of this transitory state.
This I have written for a warning to others.

In the early part of the winter, after my return from New-England, in 1776,
I was reduced to a poor state of health, and so continue.
I believe I have not lately been ever clear of a slow fever;
but have generally been able to go to our religious meetings, at and near home;
sometimes to Philadelphia, and once into Maryland, the lower counties on Delaware, etc.

In much sympathy and true brotherly love I present you with these lines,
being much disappointed in not meeting you here.
I hope you are on the mending hand,
and that I shall yet be favored to enjoy under your roof,
and among your very affectionate children, a few more of such agreeable hours,
of which I have already passed so many; when we had, added to our family comforts,
that of a most agreeable circle of dear brethren and sisters; and above all,
the Divine Master`'s presence to crown our little assembly;
when our parlor became as the school and
nursing-room for the disciples and children of Christ.

As to the business of the day, you may be better informed than by me at present;
but may let you know I am nearly through the visit to the families of Friends,
except to those in this place;
and though it is a work which has required much patience and perseverance,
yet it now affords me a secret satisfaction, and I seem clear that stopping among you,
and visiting the families in this monthly meeting, has been the way of peace.

Dearly beloved friend David Sands--

Having opportunity, I may say you are often in my remembrance,
and I among thousands should be glad to see you, in our land,
not doubting but that you will be clothed with the
garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.
I write these few lines to renew mutual love;
and to say I have lived to see the bread that you cast on the waters,
in the region of the East, returning after many days, to the glory of God;
breathing peace on earth and good-will to men;
although some sturdy oaks and tall cedars have failed every way.
You may remember, dear David,
how we passed along among the people during the inclement season of the year;
over ponds and lakes, hungry and cold;
and sometimes inwardly stripped and baptized for the dead;
all which cannot be fully expressed in this silent way
so plainly as felt experience gives it.
Although there have been great overturnings,
yet the Divine Parent causes the sun to shine, and the south wind to blow,
as the extended sceptre of his continued mercy;
watering the garden of the soul that loves him,
and even continuing to make himself manifest, at times,
to them who inquire not after him.

May the Lord of the harvest clothe your tender mind afresh
with a concern again to visit the churches in our land.
I have seen little children turn a snowball,
and it grew bigger so fast by turning that they would call for help.
As of old the fishermen did, when, by their Master`'s orders,
they had cast the net on the right side of the ship; even so,
when the sun warms the snow, and the north wind breathes upon it,
the last turning will collect more weight than several preceding ones.
You will understand my simple hints.
I conclude with a feeling of more love than can be expressed in this silent way,
and remain your assured and affectionate friend,

You are the persons our Lord has himself pronounced blessed;

May we be vigilant to serve our Master, and pray for them that hate us!
I want nothing but what my Jesus has to give, and he is always willing,
and we might be always receiving,
if unbelief did not prevent us opening wide the door of our hearts,
that he might come in and sup with us according to his promise.--I
think he is teaching me more every day,
there is nothing worth having but himself, nor enjoying,
but as we receive in it something of his love: don`'t you find it so?
If we have him, we have more than tongue can describe, we have sweet peace within,
that we enjoy by looking in faith through our interceding Saviour to our loving Father.
What mere earthen vessels we are, empty and liable to be broken:
what a blessing to see we are so, that we may ask and receive, and be filled;
that we may come up from this wilderness leaning on our Beloved!
He will hold us up, and we shall be safe.
But I must stop and recollect, this subject of a soul`'s love would fill my paper,
and after all, I have said nothing: I must leave the subject to eternity,
we can`'t comprehend, much less talk of it, though to feel it is heaven begun!

Dear Wife,

In that love which still endures, and increases in my heart to you, do I feel you;
and the further I am separated from you, the nearer you are unto me,
even in that which length of time or distance of place shall never be able to wear out,
or bring to decay.
Feel the reach of my love in your heart, and be broken and tendered in the sense thereof,
even of the heart-breaking love of God: in which my heart abounds in love to you;
with breathings to God, that we may be kept living to him,
through all our various exercises,
that so we may daily learn with the blessed and wise apostle,
in all conditions to be content; and that patience may have its perfect work in us;
for patience gains experience, and experience hope, that never makes ashamed,
but anchors the soul both sure and stedfast unto God.

Remember my dear and tender love, as also my duty and tender regard, to my parents,
for they are very near and dear to me; with my love also to Friends, neighbours,
and relations, as if named.

And now Peter Fearon, my apprentice: Mark, and take good notice what I say to you;
lay it to heart, and consider these things well, now in my absence.
My true and unfeigned love is to you,
and I desire your prosperity and welfare in all that is good,
both inwardly and outwardly;
but first of all and chiefly in that which pertains to the salvation of your soul;
the way whereof, the Lord, in His love, has in some measure made manifest unto you.
Therefore, be watchful to walk in it; that is to say,
take heed to the light of Christ Jesus in you, the measure of the Spirit of Truth,
which will lead you into all truth and out of all deceit as you do obey and follow it.
Whatever this pure light in you makes manifest to be evil and reproves you for,
depart from it, though it be that which no other eye can see nor any man know of,
yet you must forsake it,
and wait and watch daily against it in the light that makes it manifest,
and you will receive power to cast it off and depart from it.
The light, which is Christ Jesus--the way, the truth,
and the life--teaches to be sober and lowly-minded.
It teaches that our words ought to be few and savoury,
and that we be gentle and easily entreated, not high-minded,
but fearing the living God continually.
This keeps the heart clean as you abide in it, keeping low and humble in self-denial,
and willing to take up and bear the daily cross; and as this goes on in the heart,
you thereby come to depart from all iniquity.
"`All things that are reproved are made manifest by the light,
and whatsoever makes manifest, is light;`"^
footnote:[Ephesians 5:13]
and that which the light makes manifest to be sin and evil, either in word or action,
you must forsake and deny yourself in.
For this is the will and mind of the Lord, by His blessed Spirit;
and he that knows his master`'s will and does it not,
according to the Scriptures of truth, must be beaten with many stripes.^
footnote:[Luke 12:47-48]

As to things appertaining to your work and service, be patient and content,
and go quietly about your business in the fear of God.
And do not say in yourself that I will think you have not done enough,
for it is far from me to think in this way.
My only desire is, that if you do ever so little, be careful to do it well.
But, above all things, be truly willing and obedient unto your mistress,
for whatsoever you do to her, I take it as done to myself.
And mind to carry yourself in love, and be a good example in my family,
that so you may all live in love and unity together; in which the Lord preserve you all.

Dear Friend,

Well, my dear friends,
may you and I ever be enabled to press forward (leaving
the things that are behind) towards the mark,
for the prize set before us, however arduous and tribulated the path;
that neither heights nor depths, principalities nor powers, things present,
nor yet to come,
may ever be able to separate us from that love which we have been
mercifully enabled in days past to prefer to all things visible;
and may we be enough engaged so to run as that we may obtain,
is the principal desire of my mind, I think I may truly say, at this time.

As to myself, and my own movements, I have little to say,
having seldom to my own feelings been able to keep my head above water:
I am at present with our valuable friend Rebecca Jones,
who came over with Thomas Ross and Mehetabel Jenkins (now in
your land,) and several other Friends,
a little before the last Yearly Meeting, where believing it right for myself to be,
and she willing to accept of my company down into the north,
we came to the Quarterly (or what are called the Yearly) Meetings at Colchester,
Woodbridge, and Norwich, taking the meetings in the way,
and after them most of those in Norfolk, Lincolnshire, and Yorkshire.--And now,
with an earnest request that you will again let me hear from you,
I must for the present bid you dearly farewell,
and with the affectionate salutation of my best love to your whole Self,
remain your assured, though poor friend,

Twelfth Month 6th.--Since writing the above, we attended our autumn Quarterly Meeting,
proceeding pretty directly from there into the counties of Durham, Northumberland,
and through Scotland as far as Old Meldrum,
returning last Seventh-day to this place (Whitehaven,) and hope to
reach our Quarterly Meeting at Leeds the latter end of this month.
Our friend John Hall, at whose house we lodged two nights,
desired to be affectionately remembered to you,
and that I will inform you he received an acceptable letter from you at Birmingham,
which he intends to answer shortly.
He with my companion are both bravely, as was Rebecca Wright,
whom we passed on her way to Scotland, accompanied by Martha Routh.
Patience Brayton is I expect now in or near Cornwall,
Samuel Emlen and George Dillwyn and his wife in London, and by letters received,
our worthy friend Robert Valentine is safely arrived in his own land
before their Yearly Meeting in the Ninth Month which will be,
and has been cause of joy, no doubt to his friends as well as himself.

Dear Friends,

In the extendings of the love of Christ the
great and blessed Shepherd of the Lord`'s flock everywhere,
am I concerned to remember you, and stirred up to write a little to you,
as a tender and brotherly salutation.

And I am fully satisfied,
that the gracious regard of Almighty Goodness is afresh extending towards you,
in order to help you,
both to own and to live more comfortably in the dominion of Truth in yourselves;
and to enable you in the life and wisdom of Truth,
to be more serviceable in your families, in the Society you profess to be of,
(so lamentably decaying in your parts) and also to the neighborhood.

The mouths of those who mock and contemn the repairers, would, in the Lord`'s counsel,
be stopped, or turn to their own shame and sorrow;
and the seeming strength of the arm of such uncircumcised,
would appear to be mere weakness,
and like briars and thorns in the way of the Lord of hosts.

So dear Friends, brethren and sisters,
be aroused into upright inwardness of application in soul,
to have your own hearts searched by the finger or power of God;
and that in love and virtue may help and lead you in
faithfulness to labor in the work of the Lord,
that you may be fully clear of the blood of all.
I fully believe the blessed Master Builder and great Husbandman,
will yet add a blessing to your sincere application, both inwardly for your own help,
and to others; for his eye is towards you for good,
and towards the work he has begun in your parts.

And I beg it may ever be remembered, particularly by the more active for religion,
either as ministers, or other helps in the government of the church, that exhortation,
advice, or proposing the best of rules for necessary practice,
are not likely to produce much good effect,
if the tincture and savor of the spirit of religion and
gospel power do not accompany such labor,
and show itself in the life of such persons.

This leads into, and gives dominion over our own spirits and tempers,
and washes from the defiling love and spirit of this world,
with its corrupting friendships and selfish views, which have hurt many inwardly,
if not slain and laid waste multitudes.

[.signed-section-signature]
John Fothergill.

[.postscript]
====

P+++.+++ S. If I have been very pressing and earnest with you,
and not without danger of offending some, yet know you,
it is from a clear view that the Lord of heaven and earth,
who sees all things and persons as they are in reality,
is both willing and desirous to help and quicken you,
and to repair his work and plantation among you in this province;
and to water and dress it, that it may become both more comfortable in itself,
and more beautiful.
He therefore uses various means to encourage you to seek the Lord in good earnest,
to know him to work in, for and with you, for that great end,
to prevent greater desolations and forsaking, which are likely to overtake you,
through the rebellious and negligent, to more scandal and sorrow of heart.

I am now clear, and beseech that you may make proper use of this and all other favors,
both in thinking of it carefully,
and spreading it as may be judged necessary and
I seem rather moved with desire that this,
or a copy of it may go to Friends over the bay.
Though at present my hope seems weak of some,
of their regarding any thing that may be for their effectual help,
yet the unchangeable God, his holy Truth, and faithful laborers in his love and fear,
will be clear,
and have comfort in themselves from him whose ear grows
not heavy that it cannot hear in any land or age;
glory and thanksgiving be to his name forever and ever.

felt a desire to call thy serious attention to.
Not long since,
part of the goods of some of thy peaceable neighbours were taken away by force,
for the repairing, I apprehend,
the place where thy congregation meet to worship I have been led to consider
the inconsistency of this practice with the spirit of the gospel,
of which thou art esteemed a minister.
I have examined the Scriptures of Truth,
and do not find that either Christ or his apostles ever used, or taught such a practice,
to oblige those to support them, or their places of worship, who did not receive them.
__"`As ye would that men should do unto you,`"__ said our Lord,
__"`do ye even so unto them,`"__ for this
__"`is the law and the prophets,`"__
Now I am much inclined to think,
if thou wilt calmly and weightily consider this matter,
a deviation from this important injunction will appear.
If this people had the powers of the earth on their side (as thou hast in these
matters) and insisted upon thy helping to support their place of worship,
where thou hadst a conscientious objection to go, wouldst not thou think it unreasonable;
and rather that every society should support its own ministers and places of worship?
And truly there are those who from a real conscientious scruple,
cannot willingly uphold those called parish churches.

"`Now this I do not write from any desire to avoid suffering for praised be the Lord,
there is a remnant at this day,
who are enabled to take joyfully the spoiling of their goods for a good conscience sake,
in supporting their testimonies against what they believe to
be repugnant to the spirit of the gospel dispensation.`"

James Anderton,

I have lately received a general release under your hand and seal.
I much wonder you were so impudent as first to steal my goods and
rob my house for wages though I never set you at work;
and then deceitfully you make it out as if I had paid your demands,
and thereupon have acquitted me.
Be it known unto you, O hypocrite, that I never consented to pay you anything,
because I owed you nothing;
your release I return back to you again as a testimony against your deceit.
But as for the goods and money that were by you violently taken from me,
I can look upon it to be no other than theft and robbery,
which will assuredly be upon your account before
the righteous God unto whom I have committed my cause,
whose truth and servants you have reproached,
and whose worship you have disdainfully opposed.
For at Chewly, on the 10th of the seventh month,
you did prefer card-playing before the true worship of God.
Oh full of all subtlety, how do you pervert the right way of God!
You shall as assuredly feel the vengeance of God and his
fiery indignation for these things as you have done them;
and with the murderer, swearer and liar you shall be shut out except you speedily repent.

Friends and Neighbours,

Forasmuch as James Anderton has opened his mouth wide against
the innocent people of God called Quakers in general,
and me in particular; but chiefly against the Truth which we profess;
now it is well known to most of you that his enmity has
been openly manifested towards me both by words and deeds.

Now if it can be proved,
that the true worship of God is in that very way
which we meet together to worship him in,
and in that very way wherein we meet together and
worship God in is the true worship of God performed;
then it is evident,
that he that speaks against our meetings speaks against the true worship of God:
now it can be so proved,
therefore he that speaks against our meetings speaks against the true worship of God.

Secondly. We do abide in the doctrine of Christ and do keep his commandments;
as might be largely evinced according to the Scriptures of Truth.

And as for all his other accusations which he in a clamorous manner vented against us;
surely he had no more ground for them than his forefathers,
the priests and persecutors of old, had against Christ and his followers.

Wherefore in Christian love to your souls I write this,
to warn you not to trifle away your precious time;
but turn to the Life of Christ and the manifestation of the Holy Spirit,
which is the gift of God, shining in your own hearts and consciences,
which will reprove for and condemn sin in your mortal flesh,
and through believing will lead you out of sin into a state of acceptance with God;
in which continuing, through obedience,
you may come to be redeemed from the bondage of corruption,
and be brought into the glorious liberty of the children of God,
who are all led by his Spirit.

James Anderton,

Your late carriage and deportment has brought a weighty
and serious consideration upon my spirit concerning you;
and in the light of the living God,
I see your state and standing to be sad and dangerous;
and in tender love to your immortal soul I am even constrained
to write these lines in the fear of the Lord as a warning to you,
that you turn in your mind to the light with which Christ has enlightened you,
that you may see and discern your own state and condition,
while his Spirit strives with you and his mercy and
long-suffering is extended towards you;
lest his spirit cease striving, and he give you over to a reprobate mind,
and his wrath come upon you, and there be no remedy for you.
Therefore prize your precious time and your day before it be too late.

So to the light of Christ Jesus in your own conscience I once more direct you;
therein to wait for a clear understanding;
for that will make manifest to you your evil deeds and reprove you for them.
And if you turn at its reproof, happy will you be;
but if you do go on in rebellion as you are now going,
it is and will be your condemnation forever and you can not escape.
And whether you will hear or forbear; yet this light which I have testified of,
will stand a faithful witness for the Lord that cannot lie;
and from it your most secret thoughts cannot be hid.
O that you would prize your precious time,
and consider in this your day the things that belong to your soul`'s peace
before they be hid from your eyes! which is the desire of him,
who is a well-wisher to your soul, but a witness against your deceit.

P+++.+++ S.--And whereas you have threatened me with a prison
if I did not pay what you pretend was due to your father;
this I have to say and testify in the presence of the living God,
that for conscience sake towards the Lord could not
give your father anything nor pay him any wages,
because he was a deceitful worker and a false minister;
and the Lord God of my life required me to bear witness against him in his day.
And in my sufferings I committed the keeping of my
soul with all that I had unto the Lord;
who was unto me as a tender father and has kept and preserved me all along;
and has also delivered and set me at liberty: Glory over all be to Him forevermore.

And now, James Anderton, take heed to yourself what you do concerning me.
Think not that because you have a law on your side,
an unjust law will excuse you in the sight of God;
for in all ages the servants of the Lord suffered
under the pretence of the breach of a law,
by their persecutors.
And know this, that it is by the Spirit of the Lord that I am raised up,
to stand a witness for him against your ways I and practices;
and unto Him I commit my I cause,
who alone is able to preserve me and keep me in well-doing, unto the end of my days.

So in the coolness of your spirit I desire you to consider of what I have here written;
and to the just witness of God I appeal to testify to the truth of it:
and whether you will hear or not,
yet that will one day bring to your remembrance that you have been warned.

you did then and there speak and declare to a multitude of people,

Now I place this persecution upon you, because you, as I am certified,
are the most busy in this bad business.
For although your brother Hide, and sometimes one justice more,
may be present at your petty sessions, yet it is you that take upon you to be speaker,
and the rest being passive, you earnest on matters according to your own will;
so that we can do no other than give every one his due,
and lay the propagating and managing of these bad proceedings at your door.

Truly I have been concerned for you,
because of your going on in persecution against God and his people;
knowing that a bitter cup you must come to drink from the Lord`'s hand for the same,
unless you repent; and I have often considered, in pity to you,
poor man! that it would have been far better for you, if,
when your commission was taken away, you had never obtained it again,
to do as you have done.

But be you assured of this, that the Lord who searches the heart,
has your life and breath in his hand, and will not be mocked by you;
but will give you to reap according as you sow,
and render you a just reward according to your works;

P+++.+++ S.--Truly as the state of things now stands, your doings seem very strange.
What if he that now sits at the helm,
should permit or encourage you and others of your mind, on purpose to try you,
and to see what you would do,
to prosecute other protestants that dissent from you even unto blood?
Which if the Lord should allow,
you seem too likely to be an instrument for the carrying on such a tragedy,
in whose heart the old enemy who was a murderer from the beginning has ruled and does.
And when you have done the worst you can against us,
may not the Lord then in his justice, cause you to drink of the same cup,
and to receive the same measure from others that you have meted to us?

I hear you are very liberal to your clerk, in giving him what you have no right unto,
for writing your warrants, viz: Twelve-pence a warrant, and if I mistake not,
sometimes more; to be paid out of the spoil of the poor Quakers`' goods,
for all the warrants and court orders that your cruel hand has signed against them,
besides the penalties imposed.
May we not well question whether you allow him any other wages than this,
which is thus oppressively extorted, because of the multitude of your warrants.
Let it be plainly understood by what law you thus proceed;
for these doings of yours give a general dissatisfaction.
One formerly said, there was nothing worse than legal tyranny.
Take heed that you are not found in it.

And furthermore consider, do you not think that other justices,
who are more moderate and tender to their neighbours,
are as good subjects to the king as yourself,
and keep as clear a conscience in discharging their duty, expressed in their commission,
as you do?
who yet never had a hand in persecution, and do scorn to make a spoil upon sober people,
as you have done.
And as their tenderness will be for their honour here and peace hereafter;
so your rigour will be both to your shame here and torment hereafter,
without timely repentance.

But although I do write thus sharply,
yet I can truly say it is not in wrath or enmity against you;
but in a fervent zeal for God against unrighteousness, and in love and good will to you;
that you might not go on in that way which will end in misery.
And as a testimony of my love I have an intent, and some hopes,
to visit you at your house before many months more be expired,
if the Lord enable and make way for me;
and then I think to speak with you about my book which I lent you,
and you have neglected to return.

who has joined us together in that which neither sea nor land can separate or divide.

Dear hearts, I do commit you into the hands of the Almighty, who dwells on high,
and to the word of his grace in you,
who is able to build you up to everlasting life and eternal salvation.
By me, who am your dear and precious wife, and spouse, in the marriage of the Lamb,
in the bed undefiled,

An Epistle to Friends in Virginia and Carolina, from King`'s creek, in Maryland,
the 12th of the Second month, 1692.

[.salutation]
Dear Friends,

All dwell in the love of God, by which your hearts were at first reached,
and tender desires raised, to make your peace with him, which was lost by reason of sin.
It was the love of the Father to bring you to his Son, the Lord Jesus Christ,
in whom you all have life and salvation, as you abide in him, and keep in his love,
that draws your affections heavenward, where they will be fixed on heavenly things,
and where your souls will witness the sweetness of life,
strengthening and building you up in that most holy faith,
which God hath called you into, and made you partakers of.
Every one be careful to walk worthy of the vocation, whereunto ye are called,
in all fear and meekness, watching in the light,
where you will discern the wiles of the enemy in
all his cunning baits and transformations.
As every one of you keeps inward to the Lord, you will have salt in yourselves,
to savour withal, as Christ our Lord said, "`Everyone shall be salted with fire,
and every sacrifice seasoned with salt; have salt in yourselves,
and dwell at peace one with another.`"

As every one keeps to the spirit of judgment and burning,
and knows the fire of God`'s jealousy kindled against every appearance of evil,
you will be kept inquiring and taking counsel of the Lord, where you will be safe,
and can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth,
and the Lord will take delight to appear in your meetings, by his living power,
and give you a sense and feeling beyond words, as he hath done unto a remnant of you.
Blessed be his holy name forever,
that there are those who can taste words as the mouth tastes meat;
therefore is it that words cannot deceive such, but all have not attained this length;
some are unskillful, and have need of milk, which our God will give.

Therefore let your care be, to wait for the assistance of God`'s spirit,
and that none plead for the truth, and be out of the Spirit of Truth,
for that will never tend to God`'s glory, nor your edification; but on the contrary,
to darken, veil, and oppress the Seed of God, one in another.
But as all keep low in their respective gifts,
waiting to know the assistance of God`'s spirit, being nothing without it,
you will feel the Lord to work all your works in you and for you,
and give power to answer what he requires of you,
and then his love will be increased into you, and you will abide in favour with him;
as you are preserved here, you will daily witness an increase of the life of truth,
which will occasion praises to be sounded forth to the Lord God and the Lamb,
who is blessed forevermore.
Amen.

[.postscript]
====

Postscript: Dear Friends, we desire you, in the love of God,
as it was our advice when present with you, that you watch one over another in love,
and keep in a Christian spirit, forgiving one another;
if any brother have anything against another, as God, for Christ`'s sake,
doth forgive you, so forgive one another.
Take the advice of the apostle, "`Be not children in understanding,
but in malice be ye children,`" that you may bear the marks of true disciples,
and manifest yourselves to all men to be such;
that you may be preachers of righteousness to the world, that lies in wickedness,
and follow after those things that make for peace, and eschew the contrary,
and the God of peace will bless you, and keep you from evil, that it hurt you not,
to his glory, and your comfort.
Amen.

Let copies of this be taken and read in your meetings, and a copy be sent to Carolina.
So remain your friends and brethren in the truth, letting you know that we are well,
with love to you all, sending these lines as a token thereof.
Farewell.

[.salutation]
Dear Friends,

The tender salutation of our love in the Lord Jesus Christ,
salutes you all, in the spring of divine love, as those that desire your growth,
and settlement in God`'s everlasting truth, of which, in his rich mercy,
he hath made you sensible, and gathered you into,
wherein you have found great peace with God, and sweet unity one with another,
so that your hearts have been filled in your assemblies with his living presence,
which hath occasioned praises to spring unanimously unto the Lord.
