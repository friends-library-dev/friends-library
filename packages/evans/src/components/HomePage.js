      <h1>Who were the Quakers?</h1>
      <p>The early Quakers arose in the mid 1600's in England. Dissatisfied with lifeless religion, outward forms and ceremonies; they set about to return to the simple purity of New Testament Christianity. They came to see that the same Jesus Christ who died on the cross for our sins also appears by his spirit in our hearts, and that, when yielded to, this heavenly light and grace becomes our salvation as it purifies and truly changes us from within. <a href="/quakers">Find out more &raquo;</a></p>

      <h1>About our documents</h1>
      <p>On this site you will find many books available in multiple formats.  Our desire is to make these precious writings as accessible as possible to the modern seeker after truth. Therefore, each book has been converted to 3 digital formats: <code>pdf</code>, <code>mobi</code> (for Kindle), and <code>epub</code> (all other e-readers including iBooks). A growing number of our books also have a free audio version, and some are also available in a paperback edition.</p>
      <p>In addition to the various formats of the book, we also offer minimally and carefully modernized versions of each book, because most modern readers find some of the antiquated grammer and vocabulary to be a stumbling block to comprehension.
