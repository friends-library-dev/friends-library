    <h2>Compilations</h2>

    <p>We also have a number of books comprised of the writings of more than one author. Some of these were compiled and published during the time of the early Quakers, and some were compiled recently by the editors of this website. Among the latter is <a href="/compilations/truth-in-the-inward-parts">Truth in the Inward Parts</a>, a work containing extracts from the journals and letters of 10 early friends describing their convincement and spiritual growth.
