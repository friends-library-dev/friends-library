possible to preserve the original meaning, phrasing, and wording wherever possible.
Pronouns like <i>thee</i> and <i>thine</i> or archaic verb endings like <i>wouldest</i>
and <i>shouldest</i> have been modernized, and some words whose meaning has changed have
been substitued.  In some cases sentences and paragraphs have been broken up or slightly
restructured in order to best convey the original meaning to modern readers.
