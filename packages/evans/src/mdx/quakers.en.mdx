## Who were the early Quakers?

The birth of the Religious Society of Friends (called Quakers) is usually attributed to
the preaching and ministry of George Fox (1624-1691) in England, and indeed, Fox was made
a mighty instrument in the hand of the Lord for the turning of hearts and the opening of
blind eyes to the true nature, light, and life of Christianity. But the incredible
spiritual awakening and recovery of true Christianity that took place in the 17th century
cannot be attributed to the work or teaching of any man. Truth be told, there were many
thousands of believers at this time in history (from all persuasions and backgrounds) who
had become disillusioned with the many man-centered and lifeless sects of Christendom, and
who were crying out for the true light, life, and righteousness of Jesus Christ. Many were
wandering from place to place, giving ear to pastors, priests, and scholars, and still
groaning under the burden of inward pollution and spiritual darkness, longing for the
living waters that were promised to His true disciples. Finding room in these hearts for
His implanted Word, the Lord Himself raised up, gathered, and purified a people to worship
Him in Spirit and Truth, to testify against all unrighteousness and idolatry, and to call
the world back to the Christianity of the first Apostles, to the everlasting covenant of
life and light in the Lord Jesus Christ.

Not only George Fox, but hundreds of other ministers were raised up by the Lord and sent
all over Europe, the American colonies, and elsewhere, preaching the true gospel in the
demonstration of the Spirit and power. What did they preach? They preached true repentance
from the dark and corrupt nature of man, and from all dead works of the flesh, “turning
men from the darkness to the light and from the dominion of Satan to God.” They preached
Christ as the “Light of life,” the “true Light that enlightens every man,” apart from whom
nobody can truly see, understanding, or experience the things of God’s kingdom. Indeed,
this spiritual light that “shines in the heart to give the Light of the knowledge of the
glory of God in the face of Christ” is the only way that the true gospel can be
distinguished from the dead opinions, notions, and traditions of men. They preached true
freedom from sin and darkness, and an experienced victory over the law of sin and death
that reigns in the natural, fleshly man. They were not content to sit down short of God’s
many promises to “cleanse the inside of the cup and dish,” and to “purify the conscience
from dead works to serve the living God.” Instead they learned and took up the cross of
Christ, which is the power of God to crucify and subdue the man of flesh and the power of
sin and death that reigns in him. Faithfully they clung to the cross as a heavenly
lifeline, knowing that Second Man could not reign in power and peace wherever the first
man remained uncrucified. They preached Christ the living substance and fulfillment of all
old covenant shadows and testimonies. And as Christ was revealed and formed in their
hearts, they witnessed a worship in Spirit and truth in the new (inward) temple of God,
and a ministry to the Lord’s body that was the outworking of His indwelling life.

The early Quakers did not see themselves as a new Christian sect or denomination, but
rather as a return to the primitive Christianity of the Apostles, after a long and dark
night of “apostasy” from the true Spirit and glory of the new covenant. In fact, for a
time, they had no formal name for themselves, and simply called each other “Friends”
because of Jesus’ words in the gospel of John, “You are My friends if you do whatever I
command you. No longer do I call you servants, for a servant does not know what his master
is doing.” According to George Fox’s journal, the name “Quaker” originated with a
magistrate named Gervase Bennet. “This Bennet,” says Fox, “was the first person that
called us Quakers, because I bade them tremble at the Word of the Lord.” Thus the name
Quaker began as a way of ridiculing George Fox’s admonition, but soon became widely known
and used throughout the world, and was eventually accepted by the Society of Friends.

In our view, the work of the Lord in and through the original Quakers of the 17th century
was indeed a return to the original life, light, power, and purity that the first
Christians experienced and proclaimed to be the gospel of Jesus Christ. These men and
women saw the Lord, grew up in His life, and like their Master, were hated, slandered, and
persecuted for it. However, as is often the case with genuine movements of the Spirit of
God, their teachings and practices were quickly misunderstood, corrupted, and grossly
misrepresented by the succeeding generations of those who bore their name. Doctrines and
traditions can be handed down from one generation to the next, but the life of Christ must
be born in, and experienced by, each individual soul. So it is that the Quakers of today
bear little or no spiritual resemblance to their forefathers. The life and light of Christ
that once reigned in the hungry hearts of the 17th century has been almost entirely
forsaken, and the Society of Friends today is barely a shell of what was once perhaps the
greatest spiritual awakening since Pentecost.

## Explanations and Clarifications

Even from the earliest days of their society, many of the principles and practices of the
Quakers have been greatly misunderstood and misrepresented. And today there exists a whole
host of strange and untrue opinions and interpretations of their history and theology.
Before exploring the many journals and other writings of early Quakers provided on this
website, it may prove helpful to read through the information below.

### Light Within

The concept of spiritual light shining in the heart or conscience, is perhaps the most
well-known principle of the Quakers. Sadly, very few today (even among those who still
bear the name) understand or rightly represent what the first Friends taught about this
essential subject.

When early Quakers spoke of this light, they were not referring to anything that belongs
to man by nature. [Isaac Penington](/friend/isaac-penington) writes:

> “Man, by nature, is dead in trespasses and sins; quite dead, and his conscience is
> wholly dark. That which gives him the sense of his death and darkness must be another
> thing than his own nature, even the light of the Spirit of Christ shining in his dark
> heart and conscience.” “Man is darkness, (Eph 5:8) and when Christ comes to redeem him,
> he finds him to be in darkness. Christ finds no light already in man to help him uncover
> sin. Thus all the discoveries of sin that are made in the heart are by the light of
> Christ, and not by any light of man’s nature.”

In other words, natural man has absolutely no true light inherent in himself. There is
nothing intrinsically good, true, or pure in man in his fallen condition. It is therefore
not the conscience itself that is, or that possesses, divine light (as many wrongly
assume). Paul writes, “to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure, but both
their mind and their conscience are defiled.” Instead, it is Christ the Light sown as a
seed in the conscience that brings man to any knowledge of truth and, when obeyed, to the
salvation of the soul.

Furthermore, there have been many sad misunderstandings and false conclusions derived from
the Quakers use of the term “universal” in reference to this gift of light. The word
universal was used by them to establish an intentional contrast with the prevalent idea of
the time that God offers the saving knowledge of Christ to only a small, predestined few.
The Quakers rejected the idea of individual predestination, and insisted that God offers
life to all mankind through a measure of His light or grace that witnesses in the heart
against sin, and invites the soul to find salvation in Christ. It is this gracious, inward
invitation that is universal. When received, followed, and obeyed, this light becomes the
life and salvation of the soul. When rejected, the same light becomes man’s eternal
condemnation. See John 3:19-21. Early Quakers were not at all proponents of universal
reconciliation.

### Customs and Language

There were several accepted customs in the mid 1600’s to which early Friends could not
conform. The common dress of the day was very flamboyant, with an excess of useless lace,
ribbons, flashy buttons, powdered wigs, etc. The normal greetings between peers involved
scraping the right foot backwards along the ground, bowing low while removing the hat, and
then flattering one another with titles like “your Lordship,” “your Eminency,” etc. Early
friends felt that these and other like customs tended towards vanity, pride, and the
“fleshly honor which God would lay in the dust,” and so would not practice these things.

Moreover, at this time in history, the correct and plain use of “thee” and “thou” to a
single person was beginning to give way to “you” and “your.” Most modern English speakers
are unaware that the words “you” and “your” were originally plural pronouns used only to
address two or more people, whereas “thee” and “thou” were used to address one person. In
the 1600’s, it became fashionable (again, as a means of showing honor or flattery) to use
the plural “you” or “your” in addressing people of higher social status, while “thee” and
“thou” were reserved for servants, children, or people of lower social or economic
position. Early Friends stuck to what was then considered “plain language” (using thee and
thou to every single person, and you and your to two or more), rather than showing
preferment by addressing certain individuals in the plural. These may seem like small
matters to the 21st century reader, but it is remarkable how many thousands of Friends
were insulted, beaten, imprisoned, and even hanged for refusing to conform to these
outward customs that serve no purpose besides flattering the fleshly man.

### Silent Meetings

Both from their own personal experience, and from many lamentable occurrences in church
history, early Quakers understood well the propensity of uncrucified flesh to seek to
lead, govern, and teach in things pertaining to the worship and service of God. The
natural man is extremely quick to run into doctrines, opinions, practices, and traditions,
employing his own carnal wisdom and ability in an attempt to build the church of God.
Friends saw clearly that this creates a false Christianity that stands in the will and
nature of fallen man, and which (like King Saul) seeks to offer the Lord the best of what
He has already rejected and condemned.

Quakers were therefore extremely careful and intentional about waiting on the Lord in the
silence of their flesh, and feeling after His life-giving Spirit, before they attempted to
pray, preach, worship, encourage, or admonish in their meeting together. In the words of
[Robert Barclay](/friend/robert-barclay):

> “When assembled, the great work of one and all ought to be to wait upon God, and, in
> turning away from their own thoughts and imaginations, to feel the Lord’s presence and
> know the ‘gathering into his Name’ where He is ‘in the midst’ according to his promise.
> And as every one is gathered in this way, and met together inwardly in their spirits as
> well as outwardly in their bodies, there the secret power and virtue of life is known to
> refresh the soul, and the pure motions and breathings of God’s Spirit are felt to arise.
> And from the Spirit, words of declaration, prayers, or praises arise, and the acceptable
> worship is known which both edifies the Church and is well-pleasing to God. In this way,
> no man limits the Spirit of God, nor brings forth his own contrived and gathered stuff,
> but everyone brings forth only what the Lord puts into their hearts, which is spoken not
> in man’s will and wisdom but ‘in the evidence and demonstration of the Spirit and of
> Power.’”

It is important to clarify that silence was never a goal of Quaker meetings. The silencing
of the forward, fleshy mind, and the humble turning of the heart to the Lord, was rather a
means to an end, and a way to guard against the wisdom and religion of man while they
waited for the pure and powerful influences of God’s Spirit to feed and govern His own
spiritual body.

### Perfection

Early Quakers are sometimes known for their teaching that believers can become “perfect”
even on this side of the grave. The word perfect is one that can invite a lot of
misinterpretation and imagination, and so it is important to understand exactly what they
believed in this regard. First of all, this perfection has nothing to do with fixing or
changing the fallen fleshly nature. The nature of Adam is not repaired; it is
experientially crucified through the inward cross, the power of God, so that the soul
becomes progressively free from the law of sin and death, and governed by the law of the
Spirit of life in Christ Jesus. Therefore, the progress and perfection of the soul arises
from the birth and growth of the Seed of Christ within, and its victory (by degrees) over
the body of death. Early Friends believed (and many experienced) that the heart could be
united and subjected to the living Truth in such a way so as not to obey the suggestions
and temptations of the evil one, to cease from actual sinning, and in this sense be
perfect. However, they were always very careful to insist on the following two points: 1)
that this kind of perfection always allows for continued spiritual growth. As Christ
Himself is boundless and eternal, so our growth in Him knows no limits or restrictions.
And 2) that there always remains the possibility of sinning wherever the heart and mind
does not diligently and watchfully attend to the Lord.

### Persecution Against Early Quakers

Jesus said to His disciples, “You will be hated by all for My name’s sake,” and “If the
world hates you, you know that it hated Me before you.” The world’s hatred towards
disciples of Christ is rarely experienced today, in part because of the prevalence of a
cross-less, flesh-friendly gospel. It is uncommon (at least in the western world) for
believers in Jesus Christ to suffer for the enjoyment of a clear conscience before God.
This, however, was not the case when the Lord raised up the original Society of Friends.
The first Quakers were despised, persecuted, slandered, beaten, imprisoned, and killed,
both by magistracy and by the Christian sects of their time (Protestant and Catholic).
Early Friends lived at a time when very little liberty was granted to citizens to believe
and worship as they saw fit. The Church of England was run by the state, and multitudes of
laws were made and enforced mandating certain beliefs, specific meeting places and forms
of worship, and forbidding all others. Because of their refusal to conform to laws that
violated their consciences in the sight of God, Quakers suffered cruel beatings and
whippings, long imprisonments in cold, filthy prisons, cutting off of ears, banishment
from their native country, and even death. Between the years 1650–1690, prisons in England
were literally filled with Quakers who, for conscience sake, would not forgo meeting
together to worship God in the way they believed He required of them. Nor did they feel
free to attend other compulsory religious services, pay obligatory tithes to persecuting
priests, or swear oaths of allegiance in disregard to Christ’s command in Matthew
5:34—“Swear not at all...but let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes,’ and your ‘No,’ be ‘No.’”
