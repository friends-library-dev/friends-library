## Original Editions

**Original editions** are essentially unaltered from the originally published texts,
except for rare cases of modernizing spelling and some basic formatting changes for easier
reading and to match modern publishing norms. Old-style pronouns like _thee_ and _thine_
and archaic verb endings like _wouldest_ and _shouldest_ have **not** been modified.
Antiquated vocabulary has been preserved. Our original versions are an extremely faithful
reproduction of the work as it was originally published.

## Modernized Editions

**Modernized editions** have been slightly modernized from the original texts by updating
archaic spellings, word endings, and changing _thee_ and _thine_ to _you_ and _your_, etc.
No other significant alterations or abridgements have been made. Our modernized editions
are created by applying a simple (but carefully tested and refined) set of substitutions
on the text with the aid of a computer program. There are occasionally errors from the
automated modernization process, but these are generally very rare and do not damage the
comprehensibility of the text. Most of our readers find the modernized versions far easier
to understand than the original editions.

## Updated Editions

**Updated editions** have been carefully modernized by hand by one of our team members,
seeking as much as possible to preserve the original meaning, phrasing, and wording
wherever practicable. Pronouns like _thee_ and _thine_ or archaic verb endings like
_wouldest_ and _shouldest_ have been modernized, and some words whose meaning has changed
have been substituted. In some cases sentences and paragraphs have been broken up or
slightly restructured in order to best convey the original meaning to modern readers.
Updated editions have been taken a step _beyond_ modernized versions, in that each
sentence and paragraph has been read and altered as necessary according to the judgment
and expertise of the editor â€” not merely according to a set of substitution rules.

In a few cases, when preparing an _updated edition_ we have created a new work by
extracting a part of a larger work, or occasionally by combining similar and complementary
sections of originally distinct works. Wherever this was done, it is clearly noted in an
introductory remark by the editor.
