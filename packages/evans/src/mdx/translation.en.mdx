## About our Translations

All of the books on this website were written in English roughly between the years 1650
and 1850, and have been translated into Spanish with great care and precision. Anyone who
is familiar with two or more languages knows that producing quality translations is tricky
business, and the complexity increases when the original language has archaic grammar,
expressions, spelling, etc.

## Our Team

Because of their obvious limitations, we do not use machine translators (like Google
Translate). Instead, we have a small team of translators in Costa Rica, Venezuela, and the
United States who are busy every day, working slowly and carefully through every word and
phrase of these publications. Individual chapters, or sections of text are translated one
by one, and then sent to other team members to be reviewed and corrected. This section is
then returned to the original translator to be revised, and finally passed on to yet
another member of our team for a final proofing. This is a slow and tedious process, and
some of our books have taken several years to complete. But the rewarding result is a
translation that we can confidently say conveys both the words and the intent of the
original author.
