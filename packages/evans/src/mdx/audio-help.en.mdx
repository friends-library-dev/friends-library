  We currently have %AUDIOBOOK_COUNT% of our titles recorded as{' '}
  <a href="./audiobooks">audiobooks</a>, and that number will continue to grow. But
  downloading and listening to an audiobook can be confusing if you've never done it
  before. This page aims to help answer the most common questions about using Friends
  Library audiobooks to help you get listening as soon as possible.

## Download or Stream

For every audiobook on our site, you can choose to _either_ listen to the audio by
**streaming** it online from a browser, or by **downloading** it into another app to
listen. While streaming online is the simplest to understand and get started with, for
_most users we recommend downloading the audiobook instead._

### Why Downloading is Better than Streaming

- you can download the files when you're connected to a good WIFI signal, then listen
  later no matter where you are, or how bad your connection is
- audiobook playback apps automatically remember your position, so you'll never have to
  figure out where you were when you left off listening
- downloading the audiobook makes it easy to listen while driving, or doing other
  activities

## About our Audiobook Formats

Each of our audiobooks is available for download in **three formats**: as a podcast, as an
M4B file, or as a collection of MP3 files.

### Which format should I choose?

If you're not sure what format to try, we recommend downloading and listening to our
audiobooks **as a podcast**. If you're a power user, or for some reason listening as a
podcast is not working for you, one of the other formats might better suit your needs.

## Recommended Format: Podcast

### What is Podcast?

A podcast is a convenient format that allows users to subscribe to an online audio program
with regular episodes. Our audiobooks are not podcasts in the normal sense of the word,
making them available in this format has several advantages:

### Why a Podcast?

- podcasts allow you to download audio chapters ahead of time, and listen later
- podcast audio episodes automatically remember your last position
- many phones have built-in podcast apps that require no configuration to get started
- all phones and computers have widely-used podcast apps available for free download

### How to use our Audiobook Podcasts

The easiest way to get started with one of our audiobooks in podcast form is to simply
_click on a podcast link_ from the page on our site containing the book you would like to
listen to. In many cases, your phone or device will already have a podcast-capable app
installed, and it often will be able to send you straight to the correct app. For
instance, on iOS devices (like iPhone and iPad), clicking one of our podcast links should
bring you straight to the built in _iOS Podcasts App_.

If clicking one of our podcast links _doesn't work the first time,_ you might need to
download an app for listening to podcasts. Search the app store for your device for
"Podcasts" and choose something widely used and free. Once installed, try our podcast link
again. If the link still doesn't work, try copying the URL of the podcast link from your
browser and directly entering it into your podcast app.

### Common (and free) podcast apps

- Apple Podcasts
- Google Podcasts
- RadioPublic
- CastBox
- Stitcher
- BeyondPod
- Overcast
- ListenApp

## M4B

Our audiobooks are also available in the **M4B** format, which is a widely used audio file
type specifically intended for audiobooks. If you have a program that allows you to listen
to M4B files, you might want to download our books in this format. The Apple _iTunes_ app
is capable of playing M4B files, and you can also play them on an iOS device (iPhone or
iPad) using the Apple _Books_ app. There are likely many other apps that can play this
format as well.

## MP3

**MP3** is a very common audio file type usable by almost any music or audio app. If you
would like MP3s of our audiobooks, we provide the option to download all of the chapters
as MP3 files, zipped up in one folder for simplicity. Please note that most apps do not by
default remember your last position when listening to a long MP3 file. For this reason,
downloading as a podcast or using the M4B format is recommended when possible.

## Listen Online

Finally, all of our audiobooks can be enjoyed by streaming online, directly on our
website. This has the advantage of being the simplest to understand and get started -- you
just click the "play" button on the embedded audio player and you can get started
listening immediately. The main downside of this approach is that it requires that you be
connected to the internet and have our web page open the entire time you're listening, and
it will not keep your place for you should you stop listening and resume at a later point
in time.
