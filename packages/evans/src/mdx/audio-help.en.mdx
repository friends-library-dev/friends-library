## Download or Stream

For every audiobook on our site, you can choose to _either_ listen to the audio by
**streaming** it online directly from within a browser, or by **downloading** it into
another app. While streaming it from your browser is the simplest and quickest way to
start listening, _for most users we recommend downloading the audiobook instead._

### Why Downloading is Often Better than Streaming

- you can download the files when you're connected to a good WIFI signal, then listen
  later no matter where you are, or how bad your connection is
- audiobook playback apps automatically remember your position in the book, so you'll
  never have to figure out where you were when you left off listening
- downloading the audiobook first makes it easy to listen while driving, or doing other
  activities

## About our Audiobook Formats

Each of our audiobooks is available for download in **three formats**: as a podcast, as an
M4B file, or as a collection of MP3 files.

### Which format should I choose?

If you're not sure what format to try, we recommend you first try downloading and
listening to our audiobooks **as a podcast**.

## Recommended Format: Podcast

### What is Podcast?

A podcast is a convenient format that allows users to subscribe to an online audio program
with regular episodes. Our audiobooks are not really podcasts in the normal sense of the
word, but making them available in this format has several advantages:

### Why a Podcast?

- podcasts allow you to download audio chapters ahead of time, and listen later
- podcast audio episodes automatically remember your last position
- many phones have built-in podcast apps that require no configuration to get started
- all phones and computers have widely-used podcast apps that can be downloaded for free

### How to use our Audiobook Podcasts

The easiest way to get started with one of our audiobooks using podcasts is to simply
_click on a podcast link_ from the page on our site containing the book you would like to
listen to. In many cases, your phone or device will already have a podcast-capable app
installed, and it will send you straight to the correct app. For instance, on iOS devices
(like iPhone and iPad), clicking one of our podcast links should immediadely open up the
built-in _iOS Podcasts App_.

If clicking one of our podcast links _doesn't work the first time,_ you might need to
download a podcast app. Search your device&rsquo;s app store for &ldquo;Podcasts&rdquo;
and choose one that is both widely used and free. Once installed, try our podcast link
again. If the link still doesn't work, try copying the URL of the podcast link from your
browser and pasting it directly it into your podcast app.

### Common (and free) podcast apps

- Apple Podcasts
- Google Podcasts
- RadioPublic
- CastBox
- Stitcher
- BeyondPod
- Overcast
- ListenApp

## M4B

Our audiobooks are also available in the **M4B** format, which is a widely used audio file
type specifically intended for audiobooks. If you have a program that allows you to listen
to M4B files, you might want to download our books in this format. The Apple _iTunes_ app
is capable of playing M4B files, and you can also play them on an iOS device (iPhone or
iPad) using the Apple _Books_ app. There are likely many other apps that can play this
format as well.

## MP3

**MP3** is a very common audio file type that is compatible with just about any music or
audio app. If you would like MP3s of our audiobooks, we provide the option to download all
of the chapters as MP3 files, zipped up in one folder for simplicity. But please note:
when listening to an MP3, most apps will not automatically remember your place. For this
reason, downloading as a podcast or using the M4B format is recommended when possible.
