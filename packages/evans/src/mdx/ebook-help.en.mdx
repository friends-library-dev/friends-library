  Weâ€™ve made every book on our site available in PDF and two eBook (electronic book)
  formats, so that they are compatible with any computer or digital device. This page will
  explain the basics of PDFs and eBooks, and answer questions for those inexperienced with
  reading books on a screen.

## Why eBooks?

### eBooks vs. PDFs

PDFs are basically just electronic images or static pictures of text. While these are
ideal for _printing documents to be read on paper,_ they are less than ideal for reading
books on a digital device. Advantages of eBooks over PDFs include:

- fonts on eBooks are resizable for more comfortable reading
- background and colors can be adjusted on eBooks to one&rsquo;s personal preference
- eBook reader apps automatically bookmark your last position
- with eBooks, you can easily jump to and from footnotes with a click
- eBooks are legible on all device sizes, including phones with very small screens

## Which Format?

### EPUB and MOBI

There are two standard formats for eBooks: MOBI and EPUB. MOBI is a file format created by
Amazon for use with their Kindle devices and Kindle apps. EPUB is the format used by every
other e-reader app. Both formats are excellent, but EPUB is generally recommended because
it supports more modern features and sometimes results in a better reading experience.

If you're not sure what to choose, start by trying an EPUB, it will most likely be what
you need. If, however, you already read books on a Kindle device, or from the Kindle app
on your phone, tablet, or computer -- then you should use the MOBI file format. Or, if
you're planning to read on an _Android phone_ you might be better off starting with a MOBI
instead of an EPUB.

### Choosing a Format:

- using a Mac, iPhone or iPad? Choose EPUB.
- Android, Kindle device, or Kindle app? Choose MOBI.
- None of the above? Choose EPUB.
