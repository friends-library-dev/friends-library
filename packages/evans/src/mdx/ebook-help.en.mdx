  eBooks.

## Why eBooks?

### eBooks vs. PDFs

All of the books on our site are available freely to download as either PDF's or eBooks.
While PDF's are ideal for _printing documents,_ they are less than ideal for reading
long-form books on a digital device. Advantages of eBooks over PDFs include:

- fonts are resizble for more comfortable reading
- background and colors can be adjusted to preference
- eBook reader apps automatically bookmark your last position
- easily jump to and from embedded footnotes with a click
- legible on all device sizes, including phones with very small screens

## Which Format?

### EPUB and MOBI

There are two standard formats for eBooks: MOBI and EPUB. MOBI is a file format created by
Amazon for use in their Kindle devices and Kindle apps. EPUB is the format used by every
other e-reader app. Both formats are excellent, but EPUB is generally recommended because
it supports more modern features and sometimes results in a better reading experience.

If you're not sure what to choose, start by trying an EPUB, it will most likely be what
you need. If, however, you already read books on a Kindle physical device, or from the
Kindle app on your phone, tablet, or computer -- then you should use the MOBI file format.
Or, if you're planning to read the books on an _Android phone_ you might be better off
starting with a MOBI instead of an EPUB.

### Choosing a Format:

- using a Mac, iPhone or iPad? Choose EPUB.
- Android, Kindle device, or Kindle app? Choose MOBI.
- None of the above? Choose EPUB.

## What App Should I Use?
