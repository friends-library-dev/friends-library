/* 
-- the real file is hidden by vscode --
-- to see/edit do `code packages/ui/src/globals.d.ts` --

declare module '*.jpg';
declare module '*.png'

@see https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/869

If I run `yarn build` locally, it spews *.d.ts files out.
I'd like to ignore all of these, except `globals.d.ts` but
vscode can't do that. So, putting this file here to help
me find/remember the hidden file, until vscode fixes it,
or I think of a better solution.
