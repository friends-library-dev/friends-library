Later in life, Penn greatly enlarged upon the original publication, treating exhaustively upon the particular sins of pride, avarice, and luxury, and adding two lengthy collections of testimonies from other authors in order to further substantiate his position. This edition is unique in that it offers the reader a careful modernization of Penn's beautiful but somewhat archaic English, and has been abridged to contain only the principal and indispensable chapters of the treatise, wherein Penn clearly presents the nature, power, and experience of the daily cross of Christ, explaining what it is, where and how it is to be taken up, and the manner of its working in the true disciples of Christ.","filename":"No_Cross_No_Crown","published":1669,"tags":["treatise","exhortation"],"editions":[{"type":"updated","pages":0,"formats":[{"type":"pdf"},{"type":"epub"},{"type":"mobi"},{"type":"paperback"},{"type":"audio"}],"chapters":[{"title":"Forward by William Evans & Thomas Evans"},{"title":"Preface by William Penn"},{"number":1,"subtitle":"A Crossless Christianity"},{"number":2,"subtitle":"A Great Apostasy"},{"number":3,"subtitle":"The Daily Cross"},{"number":4,"subtitle":"Denying Lawful Self"},{"number":5,"subtitle":"Denying Unlawful Self"},{"number":6,"subtitle":"Spiritual Worship"},{"number":7,"subtitle":"The Sin of Pride"}],"editor":"Jason R.

The two publications overlapped in their scope, both dealing (in various degrees) with the rise of the Society of Friends, and the distinct principles and practices of this people, and it was thought that these short books could be combined and interwoven in such a way as to present the reader with a more thorough presentation of these subjects than either publication could do individually. Penn begins with an overview of the various dispensations of God in the world, and then recounts the extraordinary work of the Lord in restoring and reestablishing the true light, life, power, and purity of the primitive church through the outpouring of His Spirit in the early Society of Friends.","filename":"Primitive_Christianity_Revived","tags":["history","exhortation","doctrine"],"editions":[{"type":"updated","pages":0,"formats":[{"type":"pdf"},{"type":"epub"},{"type":"mobi"},{"type":"paperback"},{"type":"audio"}],"chapters":[{"title":"Forward by the Editor"},{"title":"An Epistle to the Reader"},{"number":1,"subtitle":"A Brief Account of the Different Dispensations of God in the World"},{"number":2,"subtitle":"The First Instrumental Author, and the Rise of the People Called Quakers"},{"number":3,"subtitle":"The Gift of God—Christ's Light Within"},{"number":4,"subtitle":"Some Objections Considered and Answered"},{"number":5,"subtitle":"The Doctrines of Justification and Salvation"},{"number":6,"subtitle":"The True Worship of God, and the True Ministry, which is by His Spirit"},{"number":7,"subtitle":"Other Distinctive Principles and Practices"},{"number":8,"subtitle":"Containing Several Exhortations"}],"editor":"Jason R.
