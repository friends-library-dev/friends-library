== Jones: The Friends Library Online Editor

> Named in honor of **Rebecca Jones,** an early Friend who was a minister and (in her early years) a highly-respected teacher of girls in Philadelphia.

* [ ] global (by friend or doc or edition) find
* [ ] match syntax highlighting of atom
* [ ] allow custom PR body composition at submit time
* [ ] allow custom commit message for re-submit commits
* [ ] delete branch from fork when deleting task
* [x] change auto submit commit message to mention jared/jason
* [x] re-fetch look for new friends
* [x] don't show friends that don't have .yml files
