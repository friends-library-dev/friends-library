Thanks to [Harry Plantinga](http://www.calvin.edu/~hplantin/) for giving me an xml file created for [CCEL](http://www.ccel.org/) containing lots of useful data which I converted into `src/books.json` for this project.

### todo
 * [ ] - organize tests
 * [ ] - add flow
 * [ ] - `format()` should handle verses from single-chapter books
 * [ ] - `format()` is super opinionated for our usage, generalize/refactor
 * [ ] - `"short"` book names should be extracted to a different config
