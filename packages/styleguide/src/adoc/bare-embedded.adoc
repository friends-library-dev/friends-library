About two hours before his death,
he spoke the following words in the presence of several witnesses:

--

There is a spirit which I feel, that delights to do no evil,
nor to revenge any wrong, but delights to endure all things,
in hope to enjoy its own in the end.
Its hope is to outlive all wrath and contention,
and to weary out all exaltation and cruelty,
or whatever is of a nature contrary to itself.

--

Thus he departed this life, in peace with the Lord, about the Ninth month, 1660,
in the 44th year of his age,
and was buried in Thomas Parnel`'s burying ground at King`'s Rippon.
