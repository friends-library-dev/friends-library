=== The Way and Manner of My First Coming to the Knowledge of the Truth, and Way of Peace, Which Had Been the Breathing of My Soul From My Youth.

After my long travail in the night of darkness and ignorance,
wherein I had toiled and taken nothing,
it pleased the Lord of his infinite goodness and tender mercy to me and many more,
to send his true and faithful messenger, George Fox, into our parts,
who published the everlasting gospel.
