In a _Lamentation_ over the General Loss of the powerful _Presence of God_
in his People since the Days of the _Apostles;_
with a particular Bewailing of the Withering and Death
of those precious Buddings-forth of Life,
which appeared in many at the Beginning of the late Troubles.

When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel;
but when he offended in Baal, he died.
And now they sin more and more, etc., therefore they shall be as the morning cloud,
as the early dew, etc. Hos. 13:1-3

=== Preface

"`My people have committed two great evils; they have forsaken me,
the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns,
that can hold no water.`" This was ever and anon the
complaint of the Lord concerning Israel,
from the beginning to the end.
