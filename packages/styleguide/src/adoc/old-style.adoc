=== A Description of Babylon / For the Sake of the Daughters of Zion / Who Presently Dwell in Her Midst.

Babylon is the spiritual fabric of iniquity;
the mystical great city of the great king of darkness.
It is built in imitation of Zion, painted just like Zion,
so that it be mistaken for Zion, and be worshiped there,
instead of the true, eternal God, and King of Zion.
