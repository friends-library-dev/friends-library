There are many likenesses of the true holiness up and down in several professions;
but there is no real holiness to be found, nor righteousness either,
but in the trees of God`'s planting,
in the branches which are by him ingrafted into the true vine and olive-tree,
whose strength of virtue and holiness lies in the sap, which they daily receive from him.

==== XVIII. Concerning Christ`'s Works outwardly in the days of his flesh, and inwardly in the day and inward shining of the light of his Spirit in the heart

Question. Which are greater,
the works which Christ did outwardly on the bodies of men in the days of his flesh,
or which he doth inwardly in men`'s minds and spirits
by the powerful appearance and operation of his Spirit?
Because Christ said, the works that he did, those that believed on him should do,
and greater also, because he went to the Father. John 14:12.
