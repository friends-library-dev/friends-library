== Some Considerations

[.heading-continuation-blurb]
Concerning the State of Things relating to what hath been, now is,
and shortly is to come to pass; warning all People to look about them,
and to wait on the _Lord_ for the unerring Light of his Spirit,
that they may know the Times and Seasons,
and the Work which _God_ is now about in the World, which is Great and Wonderful;
and so may not be found Fighters against _God,_ his Truths,
and the Witnesses of this Age and Generation;
more particularly Lamenting over and Exhorting _England._
With a faithful testimony concerning the _Quakers._

That the spouse of Christ,
the true church which God built in the apostles`' days by his Spirit,
the church against which the gates of hell could not prevail;
the church which was the temple of the living God, the pillar and ground of truth;
the woman which was clothed with the sun, who had the moon under her feet,
and was crowned with a crown of twelve stars, etc.
