But when we told him that we were the men, he was astonished,
and wondered how we escaped drowning.
Upon this the priests and professors raised a slanderous report concerning me,
that neither water could drown me, nor could they draw blood of me;
sometimes when they beat me with great staves, they did not much draw my blood,
though they bruised my body ofttimes very sorely.

But all these slanders were nothing to me with respect to myself,
though I was concerned on the truth's behalf, which, I saw,
for I considered that their forefathers, the apostate Jews,
called the master of the house Beelzebub.
But the Lord's power carried me over their slanderous tongues,
and their bloody murderous spirits; who had the ground of witchcraft in themselves,
which kept them from coming to God and to Christ.
