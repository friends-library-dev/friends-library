He moved to the side of the bed, but soon returned to his former position;
and drew his breath gently shorter and shorter, until seven o'clock,
after which he breathed no more, but ascended with joy to his heavenly mansion.
His remains were interred on first-day, 24th of the 11th month 1793,
in Friends burial ground at Ballitore.
