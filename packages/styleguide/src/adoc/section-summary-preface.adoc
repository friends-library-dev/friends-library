=== Proposition II

[.section-summary-preface]
That man, by all the imaginations that can enter into his heart,
and by all the means he can use, or courses he can run,
cannot return back to God again, or so much as desire it.

The fall of man from God is such, that it hath benumbed all his senses; yea,
so bereft him of them, that he cannot feel his own estate.
He is dead, spiritually dead; and can no more feel his death, his spiritual death,
than a man naturally dead can his natural death.
