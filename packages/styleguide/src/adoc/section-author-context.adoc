== The Way of Life and Death / Made Manifest and Set Before Men

[.heading-continuation-blurb]
Whereby the many Paths of _Death_ are impleaded,
and the one Path of _Life_ propounded, and pleaded for;

with some _Principles_ guiding out of it; and also an _Answer_ to some Objections,
whereby the simplicity in some may be entangled.
